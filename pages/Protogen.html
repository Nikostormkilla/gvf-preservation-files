'''Protogens''' are a sub-species of [[Furries]], originally made for space exploration. They are of unknown descent, but have been mentioned that they were created by unknown entities, (presumably the Furries), to explore space. They are robotic-sergal hybrids, Malice-Risu/Cool-Koinu was the first Primagen to be manufactured, but it was for her own use. She eventually made a subspecies called Protogen for others to use. Protogens are shown to be a rising fame among the community, as well as becoming Furtubers with one of the best examples being Drwildlife and Imaginatively Unimaginative. They were known for being excellent soldiers and hard to kill, which led to [[Operation Antiprotogen]] and [[The Kestrel Purge]]. Simple EMP‘s won’t work, and most bullets under 7.62x39mm and 5.56 NATO can‘t penetrate their armor, making them hard to kill without a very large volume of fire at dangerously close range. Because of this, even decades-old M1 Garands and FN FAL rifles are currently being phased in because of the AP rounds being some of the few small arm rounds that are able to pierce the thick armor up to 330m with great accuracy. They also have many unknown features that make them tough opponents in combat. They are suspected to have upgradable firmware, which can add new skills, although this has not been verified.

==Online Appearance==
When Protogen was manufactured, they first used FurAffinity to communicate with others. They did use conventions, but that only happened after the Prototuber invasion. Protogen also communicates via unknown radio link’s that have only been observed in combat.

<br />
===Prototuber Invasion===
The day when the first Protogen joined YouTube, known as the Prototuber Invasion, started on July 18, 2017 when Drwildlife joined Youtube. While not popular at the start, she got popular and influenced the furry community. Lots of Protogen joined Youtube because of Drwildlife's influence. This started the Protogen invasion.

<br />

== How They Work ==
Protogens are 60% organic and 40% machine. They are more sophisticated than the average furry and have many uses. They can also change their limbs and tail for other purposes, such as flippers for aquatic exploration as an example (see the section below). The ”Code” used to program these Protogens has not been exactly figured out. This means hacking into a Protogen is much easier said than done, and only a few Protogens have ever been able to be turned to gamer service. In fact, the re-programmed Protogens are found to run through more errors and were less efficient in their roles than the original furry-made Protogen. But there is a possibility where a Protogen can function without a code, due to fact they are half organic, this is the case of the S-protogen and their variants for example. 

<br />

==Appearance==
The appearance of a Protogen's head is more rounded than a Primagen. Beyond having organic ears, other differences from Primagen include that it stands more upright and it‘s more organic. Its torso has some mechanical parts as well as organic fur around it. The legs can be thick or thin. All the body parts except the torso and head have a “plug n' play“ feature where they can replace their tail and arms with many different types of limbs, including aquatic, space, and more to work in many situations. Its facial expressions are shown through the helmet with a variety of different colors. They look like LED lights, but how they are actually powered is unknown. There are three types of Protogens: common, uncommon, and rare. Common are normal protogen with no modification or weapons, uncommon have four ears and horns, while rare are shown to be more powerful than their common and uncommon counterparts, having six ears, extra limbs, and/or a set of wings, but they are unfortunately exclusive, and can only be made through auctions. But, there are some instances, where a Protogen can be modified for certain objectives, benefits, or personal uses, such as the S-Protogen, belonging to [[New Spain]]. However it is unknown how many are there and if most are still loyal to the Furries or some have association to the Gamers.

<br />

== Weapons and Devices ==
Protogens were armed with handheld weapons. These include many weapons for different purposes, but a much more common alternative is a right arm wrist gun. Sometimes there were pistoleer units that used rectangular-shaped auto shields that open up for increased protection. There were even more rare usages of a heat field that ejects a pulse that overheats more technological guns, but the reason it's rarely used is because it can't be tuned to overheat certain guns and, if strong enough of a pulse, Protogen units themselves. Protogen are also able to hold heavier weapons such as rocket launchers and MG’s easily and have been seen firing heavy weapons in a rifle stance. As for S-protogen the standard ones have a retractable lasgun in one arm and a retractable transonic blade in the other, their Thundergen and Primarisgen variants on the other hand have a retractable bolter in their arm instead of a lasgun.

*[[Nolan Walbrook]] ([[N-0142]]) - Transfurred directly into a Protogen after putting on one of Commie's masks. Still serves the Gamers despite the fact he changed. He was sent flying off a bridge in his car, during this his mask filled snapped off and broke. Over time, this reverted him back to a full human.
*B-0313/Breonna - Originally known as BR-3014, a battle protogen who was created by Commie from a usb from a protogen destroyed during the 3rd Furry War but was later put into an S-Protogen body named B-0313. Bought by Dime, with Orange Biker’s permission, for the DGR along with 1.2 million more, Breonna is one of the leaders of the DGR’s special forces.
*G-0525/George - Originally known as GE-0163 and bought by Saki Yoshida for her wife Dime Yoshida after successfully capturing Baron Von OWO, the protogen’s body was destroyed hours after being activated due to be mistaken for the Baron himself.

However, after buying the protogens from Commie, Dime put George’s USB into one of the battle protogen, giving George a body once again. However, like the rest of the battle protogen, he eventually was put into a S-Protogen body named G-0525 and currently serves in the DGR’s special forces.

== Trivia ==
# The Protogen were constructed in the underground factories before they were taken out in several operations. Some of these factories exist in making Civilian Protogen, and can be found around the world.
# The weakness of the Protogen is where their limbs attach to their torsos where they can customize their appearance. Shooting here with the correct caliber can amputate the limb in question. But Newer Protogens began to have more armor around their limbs to prevent more battlefield casualties.
# Some Protogen have been reprogrammed for gamer service. These are rare as most Protogen are loyal to Furries. But these Protogen have also been observed to be much more weak in combat then original furry Protogen. However, there are some instances, where a Protogen can join the gamers without the need to be reprogrammed, and can still function normally like a normal Furry Protogen.
# Some Protogen have went as far to make websites to infect other computers of Gamers. This is expected as revenge for the furry raid that occurred by the gamers during the 1st war.
# After the events of the Kestrel Purge, the remaining USF Protogen and Furry soldiers in Australia formed the Furry Remnant, a terrorist group allied with the USF. This group has been condemned for it‘s actions by the USF and UGR.
# Many combatant Protogen still exist in the USF under their own special units.
#[[Category:Protogen]] [https://gvf-war.fandom.com/wiki/Nueva_Espa%C3%B1a Nueva España] produces its own Protogen variants simply known as Protogen Español or S-Protogen. They are the first [[Category:Furry Axis]] [[Category:Subspecies]]  only Gamer nation to manufacture and utilize their Protogens.
#Protogens are semi-open species within the Furry community, as only their common and uncommon variants are open, as rare and their more improved cousins, the Primagen are closed species. But there are some Protogen that can be more stronger than their rare counterparts. Depending on the certain tools they carry.
#[[Gründer Industries]] of the [[The 5th Reich]] produces its own variant of Protogen as part of the [[Gründer Industries#The Z.O.E Protogen Pilot Program|Z.O.E. Protogen Pilot Program]].
#Recently, their armor has been upgraded, and can better withstand the 5.56 and 7.62 AK round, even with AP at close range.
