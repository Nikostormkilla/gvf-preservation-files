==Â TruncateVirus99's logs ==

=== January 28th, 2019 ===
This is Staff Sergeant TruncateVirus99 of the United Socialist Gamer Republic, more specifically the Anti Furry Foundation, reporting in on January 28th, 2019. Some of you may not know who I am, and that's fine. I've been a gamer for a long time, since before this war. Okay, back to logging. I've noticed that the furries and bronies are having a war. If we can get the bronies to help us, we will have more man power. After all, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, right? I hope more gamers will discover this and post their logs.

WARNING OPERATION FOREPAW IS WARMING UP AND WILL BE RELEASED IN THE 10TH OF FEBRUARY. THIS COULD BE THE END OF THE WAR! That was from some past vandalism. Just a heads up.

TruncateVirus99 out!

===January 29th, 2019===
Just wanted to say that I'm excited for No Furry February! Okay, back to finding furries.

===February 1st, 2019===
Today is the day, No Furry February's beginning. This month could end the war. If it doesn't, we will probably have more territory, which will be great. The place I'm at right now doesn't seem to have many furries, so I might have to travel to find some. Better get to it!

=== February 12th, 2019 ===

I have an idea. What if we sneakily picked off some furries and pull them into dark places? We'll wear masks, pull one from a group into an alley, "accidentally" let him/her escape, and then if they tell their friends, they'll jump whenever they hear a noise near a dark place. The masks are for identity concealing. Then they'll be so concerned about dark places, we can attack them in daylight more often. Probably.

=== February 12th, 2019 (cont.) ===
We all saw that guy who was completely cussing out Empoleonmaster2, right? Dang, that guy is definitely a furry. And a rude one too.
=== February 27th, 2019 ===
I have 3 things to say:
# I am willing to go undercover as a furry.
# If I find any vandalism I will put the word "vandalism" on it if it covered anything.
# Sorry I haven't logged in a while.
That is all.

=== February 28th, 2019 ===
I have a question. Is it possible to brainwash brainwashed people? If so, how? Can only a select few be brainwashed twice? How many methods are there, if there are any? Oh, and I know it's been a while, but gamerguy2767, how's that fever?

=== February 28th, 2019 (cont.) ===
lol made a wiki with dog facts contribute if you want to.

Holy Jeez it's been a long time. I came here to tell you about thots. There are 3 major ways to spot one.
# Lululemon bags
# Yoga pants
# Hydro Flasks
If someone has touched one, you must T-Pose and yell "THOTTICUS NOTTICUS." They must do the same.

Lululemon bag ranks (least danger to most danger)
# black (5 minutes till thottery)
# white (4 minutes till thottery)
# white and gold (3 minutes till thottery)
# red and black (2 minutes till thottery)
# red (30 seconds till thottery (!WARNING DO NOT LOOK INTO A PURE RED LULULEMON BAG THE PROCESS WILL BEGIN))
Hope this helps

=== August 27th, 2019 ===
I have found a new lululemon bag. It is white with black sides. It takes 6 minutes for the thottery to take over.

=== November 20th, 2019 ===
Oh boy, they got Red vs. Blue on Netflix.

Anyway, the reason I'm reporting is to say that I have captured a furry and am trying to interrogate it. Any good tips? I'm thinking of carefully disposing of sex art that they made. Or maybe gelding tongs (those were used to cut people's low-hanging fruit off).

=== November 20th, 2019 (cont.) ===
Don't worry that was only a joke. I haven't actually caught any. But I'm not kidding about the sex art. Any strays with be disposed of or returned to their rightful owners.

=== December 15th, 2019 ===
Found an audio log when I was going for my daily stroll. The log was taken... today, actually. My computer can get exact dates for audio logs. Don't ask how. Anyway, here it is.

Gamer1: "OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD"

Gamer2: "What? What happened?"

G1: "THERE'S A WHOLE MISSILE WHERE I WAS JUST AT!"

G2: "Calm down, it was most likely unarmed."

G1: "Okay, okay. Sorry."

G2: "So where was the missile at?"

G1: "The creek."

G2: "That's... that's right here."

G1: "You gotta see it though. It's HUGE."

G2: "Dude..."

G1: *panicking* "It was, like, as tall as that tree!"

G2: "Dude..."

G1: "Now that I think about it, it looked like a..."

G2: "DUDE!"

G1: "What?"

G2: "I PUT THAT MISSILE THERE! IT'S A BRONY MISSILE THAT I'M HIDING!"

G1: "You need to find a better place to hide that thing."

G2: "I know, I know."

<nowiki>*</nowiki>A flatbed can be heard nearby*

G1 & G2: "OH POOP."

Brony1: "Are you sure this will be stealthy enough?"

G2: *realises this was on an audio log.* "DUUUUUDE! WE HAVE TO FIND THE NAMES OF THOSE BRONIES!"

G1: "HOW?"

The log ran out of recording time, sadly.

=== December 16th, 2019 ===
So, I have a question. How does occupied land work? The other color of the stripes are pink, so does that make it brony land? Is it neutral land?

=== December 17th, 2019 ===
Furries can now poop and frick in Portland dog parks. Disgusting.

=== January 1st, 2020 ===
Heading to New York to help out with the uprising. Here's a list of supplies I'm bringing:
# Water
# Sandwiches
# Medkits
# Defibrillator
# Dog pictures (for morale)
# Pizza-pult
# P90 w/ holographic sights, suppressor, laser sights, pug charm
# Armor Pack
# .44 Mag Semi-Auto w/ laser sights
# Goop
# Denver Launchers
I have a large backpack and I'm headed out now. Wish me luck!

=== January 1st, 2020 (cont.) ===
I arrived in New York, but somewhere near Orange Lake, which is kinda close, but not really. Almost there, fighting gamers!

=== January 8th, 2020 ===
I haven't been feeling too well since New York, more specifically when that Weeb jumped me while I was walking out, I started watching, I can't say it, but it's a Weeb thing. It is my professional opinion that I am turning into a Weeb. Before the transformation is complete, I want to say one thing. I hope I'll be a good Weeb, and not help those disgusting Bronies.

This is Virus, signing off for possibly the last time. May you all be blessed with good sandwiches.

=== January 9th, 2020 ===
Well, the transformation is complete. Don't feel any different, still feel like a Gamer, so that's good. Only thing different is that I watch anime and read manga, and that I can actually say anime and manga. Still feel a hate for the Bronies and Furries, so I think that you still keep your beliefs. Thank God.

=== January 23rd, 2020 ===
Are we at war with the furries again? The homepage says no, but the timeline says yes. Which one is it?

=== May 7th, 2020 ===
Sooooo, quick question. How do we get our own wiki pages? What are the requirements?
===May 20th, 2020===
Oh lord someone in my class just showed off their FNAF fanfiction.

=== November 25th, 2020 ===
Heh, been a while, hasn't it? So, uhh, how's it going? Oh, right. This is a text log. Well, it's official. I'm a dumbass. Anyway, you all know about ChoofieWoo, right? My clone that, when breaking out of his sleep and becoming his own person, making his Ro-Form very much different from mine and also sucking all of my hatred for furries, past, present, or future, into the one body? That sentence made sense, right? Well, I can peek into his vision at times, due to him not completely severing the whole consciousness-swapping thing. I couldn't gather much, he knows when I peek in. So basically, he's forming plans to attack the USF. He's already gotten the blueprints to the ORS Class and built one, but after some e s p i o n a g e   t h i n g s the prints were destroyed. However, he managed to pull together an Anti-Furry crew and give the ship + crew to Franku Clean. Yeah, ''that'' Franku Clean. They're most likely planning an attack on a furry nation in space (since, y'know, they can't attack Earth with space stuff). Plus, the Ethereal Collective has been acting like they'll attack soon. I put a bug in the Temple ship and heard the Uber Ethereal talking about some plans to attack populated planets. Anyway, that's all for now, god I missed this. Adios.

General Karma reporting in. Haven't seen any hostile Furries around, some neutrals. No damage done, none taken. Will be reporting frequently. 4chan and Reddit Gamer Squads are going strong as far as I can tell. A bit of backstory - I was a soldier up until I wrote a 3-Page information file on the common Furry. I am a Gamer true and true, and a weeb as well. I am heavily against Furries, and am in command of an independent squadron, codenamed EyeMight. At the place where EyeMight is based, kept secret for safety reasons, I've noticed OwO popping up in several places. Recently, various EyeMighters recieved what appears to be a vaguely threatening message. I quote:

We're Coming - Furries

UwU

OwO

End Quote. So yeah. Will update again soon.

Gen. Karma reporting in. I found some plans, and it's bad. The Furries are working on "Parasuits", Fursuits with parachutes... They're gonna use them to take over Gamer air transports, hijack them, and bail out unscathed. Smart bastards. What happened to the plans....? I burned them.

Gen. Karma reporting in. Just staying true to my part-Weeb self - made some ramen. All is well besides that, some Furries got my Furry Info documents from me, but I stole them back and chucked them into the sewer. Never getting those back. I have more, though.

=== February 15, 2019 ===
Gen. Karma reporting in. I want to make it known that I discovered a foolproof method for identifying Furries.

Say one of the following to the suspect:
# OwO
# UwU
# Rawr
If they respond with something along the lines of "UwU" "*Nuzzles*" or "*Notices Bulge*", then you have identified a furry. This strategy works - it's been tested.

Gen. Karma reporting in. I have joined the Furry Amino undercover and am preparing to search some stuff. The Furries there seem to deny the War's existence. I've survived the Amino thus far. It seems like I have some sort of natural immunity to Furries. Huh.

=== March 20, 2019 ===
Gen. Karma reporting in. I haven't posted in a while, but I'm seemingly immune to Furry conversion techniques. This may be because, even though I support the Gamers, I'm inherently 1/4 Furry, seeing as I live with a dog, but hey, what can you do? (I still hate Furries anyway) I'm still on the Furry Amino and am currently gathering info about Codename Cobain, a Furry that we intercepted messages from. They say it has something to do with a gun. Not much info yet, awaiting more. For safety reasons, I won't be saying the name of my faux-sona (false fursona) here, as that could give it away.

General Yojin, Reporting in.

I will post some Importants Reports here (obviously).

I've been seeing in some documents of the furries send to me by our Brazilian troops in Panama. I found some documents with names of some Furry Generals, They are the Generals who took care of the concentration camps of gamers in Panama and ordened the Massacre of Hue soldiers captured in Panama. And reading some things, i was discovered some strange numbers in the final of all pages, like, some code or anything like this. For now i'm Trying to made this make sense. With the Generals, they have some plans with nothing in special, but i found a message behind the generals photos, like: "if you not make this, you family will pay for you" or things like this. I'm very suspicious, so i will continue seeing all in this.

=== February 13th, 2019 ===
General Yojin, Reporting in.

5:00AM of 02/12, some gamer spies that I had sent to Argentina to see how the thinks is going in there, tell me that they realized that some products like cosmetics, cleaning products, repels and etc, are out of all supermarket. They give me some names, Mortein, Vanish, Veja and Lysol. I think why this products are out, like, they don't like to clean the homes or something like this? Or some other things? I don't know, so i will investigate it.

=== February 21st, 2019 ===
Gamers... I was in the Paraguay fronts and, a Furry Bit me, he was killed after but, i don't know if i will be infected, so i will consume Brazilian memes, its will make me more stronger before my army will be cut off to not infect more of my body... Wish me Luck.

I have found a small group of Gamer/Gacha hybrids. The group is tiny, about 10-11 hybrids. They said they have an idea to make other hybrids if they can be recruited. It wasn't that complicated due to them not being the smartest (Sorry), but I think it could work.

Holy f*ck.

They've found it.

More so, 3 of my best GBI members, along with me, found it.

Or, ''them.''

The Reality and Time Stones.

The Reality stone is safely being held in the basement of my true base. The Time Stone is being held by me. Like Doctor Strange, I am now the protector of the Time Stone.

I have also received a note from the Furries.

<blockquote>OwO OvO UwU</blockquote>

<blockquote>OvO oVo oWo OWO</blockquote>

<blockquote>UwU UwU *Nuzzles* UvU</blockquote>

<blockquote>UwU, OVO, UwU.</blockquote>

Roughly translated by a recently changed Gamer, this is what we got.





<blockquote>"THE MIND STONE HAS BEEN IN OUR CAPTIVITY FOR A LONG TIME.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"DO NOT SEND ANYONE TO ATTACK US, FOR WE WILL KILL THEM.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"AND IF YOU DO SEND THEM TO US, DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"-THE FURRIES, UWU, OVO, UWU."</blockquote>

It's time we get the stone.

COMPLETELY DISREGARD WHAT THE FURRIES SAID. I HAVE THE MIND STONE. VIA VERY DANGEROUS METHODS AND A DEATH OR TWO, I HAVE GOTTEN THE MIND STONE. WE CAN FINISH THE GAUNTLET. WE CAN KILL HALF OF THE FURRY POPULATION. WE CAN DO THIS!

I found a spirit earlier. Seemed slightly genocidal, but that's probably because of my high L.O.V.E. They were wearing a green shirt with a yellow stripe, wearing... Brown shorts, I think.

They went by Chara. Funny. Undertale is real, ain't it? (Laughter.)

Anyways, they're following me around. (Yes, yes I am.) They also showed me that I have a SOUL. A SOUL of... DETERMINATION. I was confused. (Well, stop being confused.) Shut up.

Anyways, then they showed me A FUCKING SAVE POINT. I swear, Undertale. Is. Real.

I... Can't save, though. I can only see it. I wonder who has more DETERMINATION...? It doesn't matter.

== Chidori Lulz's Logs ==

=== March 21, 2019 ===
My ancestors begun writing tales of their lives whilst also guiding the youth in a guide, which I have discovered locked with my grandfathers body underneath the capital in his tomb. The book itself is worn and could turn to dust at any second yet it doesn't. I asked Empy his thoughts but he believes it to just be a worn and old useless book left behind by those who feared for their spirits. The title of it is "æ°¸é ã®çå®", or "Eien no Shinjitsu" which means "Eternal Truth" once translated. Within its contents there are stories and tales of old that have brought forth vivid imagery in my dreams. I feel like their is much more to this book than what Empy claims, and especially more than what meets the eye.

=== April 4, 2019 ===
I was reading the Eternal Truth some more, and it seems my ancestors were onto something. The mentioned the city of Sapporo, that city with one of the biggest red light districts in all of Japan, where some key was hidden. It also mentions that once they found the key they would take a ship and cross the sea and travel through Korea into northern China to find some place called "Xanadu". Its strange because my parents would tell me of this mythical place where no one has reached. I'll have to look more into it, but as of right now my country needs reforms and a better law system, as well as an ascension date.

=== April 26, 2019 ===
'''Phrase taken from a conversation between Empress Chidori and Head Magistrate Empy'''

"Xanadu Empy! Thats the key to it all! If we find Xanadu, we shall find 'immortality' through honeydew and paradisaical milk. We will become the last humans on Earth! Thats what my ancestors were after, to defy their creators and become greater than them. The Eternal Truth tells of a land in northern China that can only be opened through the use of a key found in an eastern land, that whoever dines on the fruits of its labor shall never know disease nor death! Thats the key to ending the wars and bringing peace Empy!"

''This is an interview of a furry that's currently being held in Cell 1, which seems to always have a <s>owo</s> sign on the back wall. Interviewer-R&D's Dr.Normal''

"Furry number 24601, you are currently going to be escorted to interview room 18 for information and testing. We will designate you for termination if you do not comply."

''Furry #24601 is shown being escorted by two guards with Regulators in their hands. The subject is seen licking her paws/hands and meowing.''

"Now, 24601, let me ask. How did you become a furry?"

''The subject is shown to not answer, preferring to continue licking her paws.''

"24601, answer or you will be designated for termination."

''The subject seems to hiss, then procceds to break her bonds and attack Dr. Normal whilst chanting random gibberish in Cat.''

''"''The fu-? Open fire! Subject 24601 designated for termination!"

''The guards manage to terminate Subject 24601 before any harm can be done to Dr.Normal''

''Her corpse is now the subject of study of the R&D department in Classroom 2.''

Damn, that has to be one of the scariest things ever to happen to me today. Please don't let further interviews precede without proper equipment.

''Internet cuts out, as the 14th saves General Final Hope just as the furries bust down the door.''

Also, we had to use auto-correct, for he accidently kept on saying the wrong words.

=== May 23, 2019 ===
After General Final Hope had almost a month without anything bad happening, he became suspicious. He kept on looking behind his shoulders and shot anyone who looked suspicious. Finally, on May 23, 2019, an army of furries walked up to the base of the [[4th Guerrilla Gamer Force]]. The confrontation between General F.H. and the furries went like this

"Are you General Final Hope?

"Unless you know another 5-Star General in this base."

"Then, surrender, or else!"

''General proceeds to pull out a Nerf Rival Zeus''

"Why don't you surrender in 5...4...3...2...1..."

''General sprays and prays whilst he shoots at the furries.''

=== June 15, 2019 ===
General Final Hope today has just scheduled a very ambitious plan to take Los Angeles from furry control. When asked why he did this, he responed by stating,

"Why, I believe that if we gamers want to defeat the furries, we must make the second biggest city in the furry-occupied U.S. should come to gamer hands if we want to win this war. for, I myself, for the first time in months, will personally lead the gamers into the Staples Center and execute all furries there. I don't care if I die, I just want to get L.A. and all of Southern California into gamers hands. Now, I must make some plans. See you soon."

=== June 17, 2019 ===
'''WARNING-THERE IS SOME CUSSING, BUT IT'S SORTA COVERED UP'''

After asked what he thought about Memus stating that General Final Hope was going to get himself killed because of his ambition, he replied with...

"F*ck what Memus thinks! I don't give a goddamn sh*t about what that dunba*s Memus thinks! I'm a Laker's fan, and I don't care if I die! I want to liberate Staples Center, and who f*cking cares if I die! No, tell Memus to go f*ck himself, because I don't give an sh*t about what he thinks! I'll go Showtime breaking down the front doors of Staples and kill every f*cking furry I see! Masakit ang f*cking save Los Angeles at ilagay ang aking gitnang daliri sa mukha ni Memus kapag nanalo kami! Mabuhay ang mga manlalaro!"

It was later found out that General Final Hope was drunk after celebrating about A.D. being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.

"Help, I'm only allowed five minutes before the furries check on my cell, so I need to be quick. After I published Operation SD Padres, the furries managed to track me down in my private cabin in Crescent. I was busy trying to make it to Washington, but then the furries fond me. I'm not allowed to say the name of where they're holding me, for they will instantly make me a furry, but I'm allowed to give you guys a riddle-

Back up North, where the snow furries roam, there's a city where the Grizzlies used to play before Memphis made them relocate. Now, in that city, there's a park. A beautiful park, named after The Office's African American salesman. Now, if you can find me before the 31st, I will be saved.

Please, save me. Now I have to go. Bye."

This is actual audio recording of General Final Hope when rescued by some paratroopers found him locked up in a mantinence shed in Stanley Park, Vancouver.

"No furries, I will not give you any... what was that? Oh, paratroopers, thank God! You figured out I was in Stanley Park, Vancouver, and just Ithe nick of time! They were just about to turn me into a furry at 1:20 A.M.! We have to hurry, my watch says it's 1: 19 A.M. we better go, before they send reinforcements. Now, before you transport me to forward base, just tell Memus I'm sorry for what I said, I just had a little bit of beer, and I was too drunk to think about my actions. Anyways, tell that toemus, alright? Good, now we out to leave, the furries are bound to come back, assuming they watch you guys kill that git of a furry intterogater, he's even trash at tourture. Now we need to go, '''now. '''Bye, Stanley Park, goodbye and good riddance!"

This was General Final Hopes reaction to when an Officer informed him that Memus was gone

"What do you mean Memus isn't here! Where is he! No, it's a private conversation, just me and him, and you don't have the clearance to listen to it! You're only an Officer, and- are you pointing a gun at me? Because if that's a gun, you will be arrested for treason, but seriously, don't shoot, don't f*ckin-"

Audio Recording of General Final Hope and his doctor

"So you're saying that Officer wasen't an officer, it was really a furry?"

"Yes, Adam (Only General F.H.'s doctor is allowed to call G.F.H. by his real name). Luckily, your solder blades are still in one peice, and the bullet didn't have any furriness on it."

"When can I leave?"

"Adam, you're shoulder blades literally has a hole in it, so maybe, on the 28th."

"K"

"Now Adam, we're going to perform surgery on you, so please relax so we can put you on the gurney."

"Seems like I always get to trouble, eh?"

"Yeah. Now, we're going to give you some anesthesia to calm you down"

"it seems like the shoulder blade is still salvageable, but... there seems to be an infection..."

"A furry infection?"

"No, just a normal infection..."

"BPM is 120"

"Good, seems like the infection is minor, it will be gone by the 27th with antibiotics"

"Great! I'll tell Memus!"

"Not right now! We need to finish up."

""Alright, alright. But are you sure he'll survive?"

"Yes, now shut up."

=== June 27, 2019 ===
"Doctor, how did the surgery go?"

"It went fine, except for one thing..."

"What?"

"We gave you the wrong prescription by accident, and now..."

"What?"

"You may have...Trap urges for the rest of your life..."

"Wtf? Why?"

"There was some...Anime in that tablet, but on the bright side, the infection was cured..."

"Well, I better be off now, I need to get the 4th prepared."

Is this the real life? I don't know anymore. The furries are coming for my hometown and my beautiful SoCal. I can not let this slide. If they close in on me, will be forced to use this-(points at sacrificial Filipino Tribal Knife) on myself. They shall not kill me, I will go out my own way-one way or another. I, President-Field Marshal Final Hope, promise to abandon ship last, and I will never go down with that furry scum.

It has been a wonderful time serving us gamers, and with the time coming, and my duel with Shovel being put off until August 30, it has been an honor serving you guys. I think we should-(Pulls out a wine glass, pours Mountain Dew Red in it)-have some toast to some people: To Chidori Takeda-Lulz, who has given me my healing powers, to Empy for guiding me to the end, to ChiefGamer, who has no doubt made my time in the army more interesting, and to Field Marshal Yeet, who I think is the only other person who can match my love for Broadway. Now, let us-(Raises glass) raise a glass to freedom, for we may not have it for a while. And if I die, just know: I did it for my country. Thank you.

But thereâs a problem: I go kill too much at one time, it will kill me. So just remember: Iâm going down swingin.

Hello, whoever is listening to this. I'm sure you know who's speaking, war vet that has served for the Gamers for a long time. It probably was obvious who was talking by my voice, but yeah. I'm just going to say this, get all the soldiers you want out of California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Arizona. That's an order. The people that are left in those former states are going to be part of the new republic.

=== April 27th, 2019 ===
For the past three weeks, we've (The [[76th Armored Gamer Regiment|76th]]) have been somewhat successful, taking minor camps on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The [[12th Gamer Resistance Division|12th]] have opened up fronts past the San Francisco peninsula. We've been draining Furry resources via raids and bombings. We've been feasting on both the finest meats and Furry bodies. We've set up an R&D division, and have been working on a more stable version of [[Plasma Goop|Goop]] for Chief and our own Soldiers. For whomever reads this, this is the quote I want to be known for:

"A Gamer can die to a Furry today, but thanks to the blood I have shed, thanks to the bombs I have dropped, thanks to all of my own who have fallen, can now recover from the bites. They can live to fight a dozen battles or more." - Major General Memus

I will be leading the 76th on a large raid. I will march into Anaheim, and I will commit a genocide of every Furry in that city. I will take the city, recruit every gamer in the state, and march on Sacramento. I will get the Iron Controller, and I will get one over on Hope. He will have no Hope left afterward, and neither the Furries. I will lead the great revolution. This is not War, this is Revolution.

=== April 29th, 2019 ===
Today's the day. The Long march begins. We have packed up all our troops, weapons, and vehicles. I stand in my command tent tonight, talking via radio channel 12, broadcasting over California.

"In two days we will drive these furries out, IN two days we will battle for Sacremento. The 12th and the 76th will commit a genocide. We'll redraw the map of the continent. And we won't stop. We will take Furry Oregon, Furinton, Furry Columbia, and Furrkon. We'll fight through the cold map for a battle royale. We'll take a win, the Furries, an L." - 19:00 Hours, Coms Channel 12.

=== May 19, 2019 ===
Well, the long march was a failure.

We arrived behind schedule last week, two days later than expected. The Troops were starving as our already limited supply deliveries had to march miles over hostile territory. The Air Support can't arrive this far north. The 12th, however, was able to meet up with us. We fought valiantly. But now we're at a stalemate. The garrison we left behind at Anahiem is now under control of the 4th. Well, at least they're in good hands. I was listening in on Furry Channel 0323, this showed up (translated from a Dog-based cypher):

"Goddamn Barklsey. These gamers are being more of a hassle in the south then orignally planned."

"You think?"

"let's route the [Lost in Translation] and [Lost in Translation] on the left flank?"

"Ruffer. Out."

Well god damn, I better reinforce this flank. Here we go. Our battle will be legendary, "The Uprising of San Francisco." I'll call it. It '''will '''go down in history!

=== June 15, 2019 ===
I can't do it.

I'm down men. I'm down supplies. The gays are steamrolling me. They've taken LAX and no supplies can come in. If this persists, Catalina will be the last bastion of gamers in California. I've got an operation to carry out.

=== June 16, 2019 ===
It is the night. After Hope only made it out alive, It was up to me, and my handful of men to retake the city, and the Headquarters. Street by street. House by House. Disneyland attraction by Disneyland attraction. The Garrison in the city was no match for power armor gamers equipped with laser rifle and Nerf Rhinos. We have established a bulkhead and are ready for the liberation of LA!

=== June 16, 2019 (Cont.) ===
Is Hope insane?

He wants WHAT? The Staples center is one of the most heavily defended strongholds. He would have to take it room by room. My own men are tired after Liberating Anaheim. LA is a few orders of Magnitude Harder. What does expect? A Cakewalk? Damn him. His ambition is going to get him killed.

=== June 18, 2019 ===
It is time.

[[Operation Oregon Dreams|Oregon Dreams]] needs to work or we're about to lose Hope. He may have been short-sighted, rude, and a slight bit of a drunkard. But he was brilliant - sober or not. I'm seizing command of the [[4th Guerrilla Gamer Force|4th]]. They'll stay here, protect Cali. Hold the lines. Reinforce and resupply by ship. The [[76th Armored Gamer Regiment|76th]] and a portion of the [[12th Gamer Resistance Division|12th]] are coming with me for Oregon Dreams. From there, I have a plan. But after Hope's plans got seized, I won't be releasing them.

And Hope, if you're reading this, We'll be knocking down their goddamn doors by tomorrow. Well, maybe that's optimistic. God Bless the Twenty-Ninth.

=== June 19, 2019 ===
I've been panicking at my command desk for hours, pouring over Oregon Dreaming. But nothing looks, ''right'' it all seems, ''odd''. Certain Landing points and beaches seem too far from Furry occupied cities to keep supply lines running. I'm worried. I'm worried about Hope. About my Men. About my Family in Oregon. About how the 12th is holding up in San Fran. Panic is descending upon me. God Bless the Twenty-Ninth.

I've heard about Angels of Anaheim. I've brought forth a new Plan to my battalion commanders - Operation Patriot. It'll take everything that isn't spent in [[Operation Oregon Dreams|Oregon Dreaming]]. We will fight the battle Fusion Cell by Fusion Cell, AP by AP. Inch by Inch. Centimeter by Centimeter. Millimeter by Millimeter. We will take back everything.

God Bless the Twenty-ninth.

I've been insulted, defaced, and discriminated against. Nuclear Warheads are a perfectly viable method of warfare. Especially in a shore invasion. Leaning from History-

'''NO'''

First the chaos with Hope. Now this. I'm '''F(_)CK1NG DONE WITH THEM'''.

'''S T O N K S'''

=== June 24, 2019 ===
I've seen what atrocities they've been committing with my own two eyes. I'm getting demoralized. My Family is all dead. I've no idea what's gone on with Hope's surgery. I've asked his doctor, I've filed a report through my secretary. No Clue what to do. Now, in regard to Operation Patriot. I've been preparing for a week now. We're entrenched. The Line is being held. Freeways are no-mans-land. We've set up batteries. And the furries are none the wiser of our Paratroopers. Those B@st@rds are going to die. Once Los Angeles Falls, the 12th can take the northern offense. The 76th will meet them in Sacramento with the Oregon Forces.

A Liaison has delivered me the files for Hope's recent Surgeries. He will probably survive. Thank '''S T O N K S'''. Wait, GTT058? No. No. No No No. This. NO! '''NO! NO NO NO! '''Hope, Fire your doctor. It is what is good.

Something like, I dunno, Micheal Jackson. Or P!ATD. Or TWOP. Wait. Not TWOP. FOB. Or Imagine Dragons. Or even Smash Mouth. Literally anything is better than queen.

Sh1t. It's recording. Ah F(_)ck it.

(Hey Look Ma I Made It plays in the background, followed by Zero by Imagine Dragons. The Recording keeps going for about 15 minutes, until silence is heard)

=== June 30, 2019 - Day A ===
Today is the day we push not just against the furries - but for America! FOR GAMERS! FOR EVERBODY!

"...and today we stand facing our greatest foe - one about to perish! We are Gamers! We are MEMERS! WE ARE AMERICANS! We will take our great country back from those Furry Ejits!"

-Excerpt from a Speech from Memus to his troops.

=== July 1, 2019 - Day B ===
We stand on the edge of Los Angeles. We are 2 days ahead of Schedule. Let us go! Let's PUSH!

=== July 2, 2019 - Day C ===
We took the Jewel out of the Sands. It is our day now. We've met the 12th. It is time to go to Sacramento. We have a day of walking and fighting at the least.

=== July 4, 2019 - Day '''E''' ===
It is our time. Our march was ruthless. We executed it like a Furry Aristocrat. Nothing at this point could've stopped us. Except our dead allies. Over 50,000 just From the 12th and 76th. Bilvad hasn't handed over the documents related to the casualties on his side. We've lost so much. But I used PA-489 for the first time. It was quite the adventure. I lost ''some ''metal, but over the whole, it was effective.

=== July 6, 2019 ===
It's time to burn this wiki to the ground. Like Muller before him, I wish him well. I'm seizing control of the 4th and 5th on his behalf for now. Goodbye, Partner.

=== July 7, 2019 - Audio Recording of A Call between Memus and a Scientist (Codename: B-17) ===
Memus: Okay. I have an Idea.

B-17: Just get to the bomb.

Memus: Don't you think I would just call to talk about a video I'm making?

B-17: No.

Memus: Anti-Matter. Metal 489 based.

B-17: You are insane.

Memus: Yes. What's your point.

B-17: It's just a theory-

Memus: '''A GAMER THE-'''

B-17: Give me another batch of defectors, we'll talk. (Hangs up.)

Memus: Well, I'm going to have get some defectors. (Recording End)

=== July 11, 2019 ===
We've got plans.

We've got Vertibirds.

We've got Guns.

We're coming for you tommorow Morning Muler.

You German B@stard

=== July 14, 2019 ===
We've wrecked the camp, but the day isn't done. Muler needs assistance. Engineering crews, salvage what you can from the MiGs and fix the Vertibirds. We'll be there by 8:05 at latest ladies! Pilots, suit up. Gunners, check your ammo. B-17 and crew, get the bomb ready. We'll take all of us with it if we have to. We're coming M, I assure you.

Telling myself that this log was irrelevant was wrong. Very wrong. I told myself to put down the recorder. But I can't. I'm in the scorching heat of Nevada, with Family, Heading back to my old pal SoCal in, a week, I think.

Everything but the Marines is deployed. Penetrating South Oregon. Providing a lot. I'm with the Guard. Let's finish this war fast.

''The National Memer Library has closed in observance of the Death of [[Chidori Takeda-Lulz]], this log is not available to stream or download.''

=== Recovered Tape #1 ===
No. No. No No No. HELL NO! I'm not losing everything now. I've gotten this close to finding Eliza, but now she could slip from me. I can't let this happen. Tell B-17 I'm heading out. I've got ''buissness ''to do.

=== Recovered Tape #2 ===
The Damn Plan. The Plan. Something about Greece. Ever since I left them, started a new life, I've lost contact with my comrades. I'm contemplating suicide. I can't live like this. They'll never take me back. Damn, I need another Beer or something to take my mind off this. I'll work my sorrow away.

=== Recovered Tape #3 ===
One more thing, I'll end it all. I've kept nothing but an open door to the Gamers. But then they discard me, throw me away. I never meant for it to unfold this way. I can't run a buissness anymore. I'll draft my will. I'm bound to die in the next few days or so.

=== Recovered Tape #4 ===
Eliza, I love you. If you're recieving this tape, I'm dead. Don't give up my child. I'll leave you something so you don't have to fight anymore. Move to the countryside. Enjoy the protection I built for myself. Enjoy the wealth. Take care of B-17, let XR guide you.

Hope, you're a great man, thank you for your service. We had our Quarrels, but that's behind us. You've been behind me in every way since the beggining.

Chidori, I wish only the best for you. We've argued, but you've been nothing but a model dictator. You've removed polical strife and hate from the Iron fist. Seperated the inseperable. Respectable of you.

Karma and Yeet, lead well.

Chief, don't let Chara consume you. You have all your years ahead of you kid.

Shovel, you're a great man, leader, and customer. Your war is beyond me, but I accept your cash any day of the week.

Muller, you're a respectable man. May you be lead to more prosperity. You're good Field Marshal materieal.

Aliel, I have nothing good to say to you besides goodbye.

Billious, treat my partner well. You each have what the other doesn't, cooperate.

I love you, I love you all. You'll find my will under my bed in my mohagany chest.

Dankus B. Memus

This is my first day leading an entire division, i hope it goes well, so far, id say it is, things are going smooth sailing at the moment, no confirmed furry attacks on our base yet, but im expecting that soon.

=== May 10th, 2019 ===
After the confirmation of general token fat kid's death, i started a project on developing a strain of revival potions.

Oh no, chidori took down the expiriment because she highly doubted we would make a breakthrough. She said the best alternative was to make an android for token to control, but the furries captured the head, and is keeping it under protection. Now theres no way to bring token back, press F.

=== May 11, 2019 ===
The furries have launched their first attack on base, though pewdiepie launched a ruby play button rocket, and it made quick work of them. And we've been receiving info about needing to distract the furries on the front lines while the gamers sneak in around the back. I dont have many youtubers with me on this one, luckily, the attack will take place in a couple of days, so i have time to recruit some more, i managed to recruit team robust (kwebbelkop, jelly, slogoman), team epiphany (Papa jake and logan) and finally, the key family (collins, devan, and some others).

=== May 13, 2019 ===
Now we were ready to attack. And it was successfull. the gamers managed to sneak into the furry base, and managed to find out how to get passed security in the furry chiefs hideout.

I've barely managed to start this recording. I'm... in a bit of a situation here! They've found me! For safety measures, I've started playing some gamer music... to slow them down, weaken them... ''but it's not helping much.''

Not much of a problem, though, but '''it's not just furries. '''It's not just furries chasing after- agh! There are also... help! Hel-

''End communication.''

=== November 4, 2019 ===
...

Why did I abandon everyone? What was the point? Was it because I had to save myself before I was taken over, like my head was splitting; back in October? I know what I must do now. I have to go back! I... I have to tell them what I did! What horrible things I've done to both them and myself... no... not now. I'll go back to them, but I'll tell them later.

''End... end communication.''

== Lt. MÃ¼llerâs Log ==

=== June 17, 2019 ===

I have received 30 troop transports for Operation Oregon Dreams and plan to use them for bombardment before rushing them up the beach. I got into an argument with Chief as well today and feel bad about it. Anyways in case someone finds this journal on my dead body, Iâm Lt. MÃ¼ller of the [[4th Guerrilla Gamer Force|4th guerrilla Gamer Force]] and am writing operations for Oregon Dreams: A D-Day like Operation where I will parachute behind enemy lines with other forces of the 4th Guerilla Gamer Force, destroy any bridges while killing reinforcements, and making sure that the furries canât reinforce the beach. Then, the amphibious assault begins with troops disembarking the landing craft to take 5 separate beachheads Codenamed Forepaw, Highlands, Strongarm, Mega, and finally, the beach I will support, Mastodon. These beachheads will help our troops to liberate the west coast of the furry tyranny that occupies these golden hills and green forests. So if you find my journal here, deliver it to command. They will need it.

=== June 18, 2019 ===
I have received more aircraft for the invasion and have almost finalized it. The operation now has more forces than ever before. Oregon Dreams will be successful and I know it. Despite me being the main commander of the operation, I am going to parachute behind enemy lines with my fellow soldiers of the 4th. We are almost there. Almost there.

=== June 20, 2019 ===
The operation is now finalized. And even better, General Final Hope was rescued in canada! I was able to solve the riddle and sent in paratroopers to his position. We need to end this war now. GOD BLESS THE 29TH!

=== June 21, 2019 ===
Today was my birthday and I got the honor of having a Sharpfire blaster delivered to me for use against furries. It is a convertible pistol Carbine that comes with a detachable stock and barrel. I will use this often.

=== June 22, 2019 ===
I will be shipping off to training at Camp Marston to prepare for the invasion tomorrow. I will be inactive until the 29th once I am dropped by airplane into Pacific Beach, Washington. Got into an argument with General MacArthur today and he took away all his troops. He played us like a damn fiddle. God bless the 29th.

=== June 23, 2019 ===
I will be going to attend training soon. Our troop count is now half a million. Iâm gonna leave soon. So this is my last message. This may be the last time you see me. If so, these are my last words...god bless the 29th. Tell my family I love them. Just like Kenau Reeves. God bless our souls. God bless.

=== June 28, 2019 ===
guess what boys,,, IM BAAACCKK!

=== June 29, 2019 ===
I can see the beaches from here. They are shelling it to ScheiÃe. The row boats we have wonât be too good, but they are metal and with a canopy. Man.. the beaches still look good. Thought they were supposedly flattened. Well we are going over the top. We need to stop these furries now. This is our only shot. Ever since I could hold a Gewher, I always wanted to be like you Pa. But you have always been a tough act to follow... itâs now or never...

Call to Lt. Muller from Final Hope:

Hope-Muller, hows it going over there?

Muller-Good, and what are you listening to?

Hope-Nothing...

Music-As he came into the window, It was the sound of a crescendo, He came into her apartment, He left the bloodstains on the carpet, She ran underneath the table, He could see she was unable, So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Muller-Is that smooth criminal?

Hope-Yeah.

Music-Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie?

Muller-Anyways, we're good, how about you?

Hope-Amazing!

Music-Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie? You've been hit by. You've been struck by. A smooth criminal.

Muller-When are you coming to the front lines?

Hope-At 4 PM Pacific Time...

Music-(Stops for a little bit, and then...)Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time, I feel alive and the world I'll turn it inside out, yeah, And floating around in ecstasy, So don't stop me now don't stop me, 'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time

Muller-Well, I have to go, and, oh, Scheisse! Die Furries sind da! Roll out, MÃ¤nner! Stellung nehmen! Medizin! Wir haben hier ein paar verletzte MÃ¤nner!

=== July 1, 2019 ===
We did it.. we actually took the beachhead! We flanked around the remaining furry strongholds and took the beach! We stretched out so far that we have forces that are in Olympic National Park! We also took back other costal towns to make the beachhead bigger. Our troop count from new reinforcements is over 500,000. We are advancing up into Olympic National Park. Gonna be like Vietnam here. We have to take this park. It is very important. We should have it taken over by the 2nd...we have a fourth of die park right now...

=== July 2, 2019 ===
We took the Park and now we are in Seattle. We must free this city. I formed the Oregon Resistance today as well! We shall storm Seattle and be done by the 3rd. We almost have the entire city. We have half of it now. Wonder how long it will be.

=== July 4, 2019 ===
One hell of a firework show. I was able to watch it from the space needle. But then I had a meeting inside the command tent. And as it turned out, Oregon Dreams was not really going as well as it was said to be...I have to take action now.

=== July 7, 2019 ===
Ok. These furries keep getting worse. And worse. And noticeably worse. I had been given the orders to move into furry territory in Oregon. At the wildlife safari zoo, I was able to board a convoy for my mission. My Codename was Midnight and my fellow lieutenantâs name was Lake. We were both sent in to extract a sort of injection that could turn regular animals into furries. The furries captured the zoo by force and by the 2nd day, the park had fallen. They used this park to convert the animals. While in the convoy, we escorted some animals forwards out of the Northern America area and into the African Area. You could see bruises and cuts and furry troop got out and loaded Animal#73 into our truck. I briefed the mission to Brady (The Lieutenant) and told him that we had to find the extract. Upon further searching of the park, we found the laboratory, disguised ourselves in a lab coat, and snuck in. Me and the Lt. found the extract and called for extraction. A force disguised as a furry convoy taking deer, took Animals from #70-#120. Then, we released the animals into the wild far from the park, and took the extract for testing. The scientists call it The â UwUilizerâ. They were able to duplicate a bottle for testing and I am watching them test it on animals right now to see if what I said was true. Well the animal became a furry and was put down. We need to test this more.

=== July 10, 2019 ===
Alright Listen up... the convoy I was on went to put the UwUilizer in the lab and then went back to base. We got ambushed roughly 5 hours after leaving the lab... I burned the intel and anything that could help the furries. Lucky me that I did that. Everyone else expect me and the Lieutenant were executed. But since we destroyed the intel, the furries decided to have us suffer in one of their own prisons since it would probably be worse than death. We are currently in a furry P.O.W. Camp. I am giving this message out on a guards computer while they are out and about... I donât have much time. Iâll give my coordinates while I can. I am currently in the town of Sutherlin Oregon and am also being held under heavy furry guard. They are going to transform us all into furries by the end of the month. We need backup. Please send some sort of special operations unit. I donât see any way we can break out. ScheiÃe! They are coming! Quickly! Send help before the 29th!

=== July 14, 2019 ===
Thanks to the Oregon Resistance, Iâm now free! Iâm still waiting at the river. If we can cross that bridge, we can get into Oregon. My brother Ivan is with me. Good sniper. We will see how things work out. I gave Ivan a journal yesterday. He is yet to write in it...

=== July 14, 2019 (Cont.) ===
<nowiki>**</nowiki>Radio Call over Ivanâs tank while advancing in an attempt with another division to take the bridge.**

Ivan: Alright boys. This is one of the bridges! We must take it!

MÃ¼ller: Dagwood White 5 to Hunter 2-1 whatâs your status over.

Viktor: This is hunter 2-1 we are about to invade the Bri-

A loud explosion is heard over the radio

MÃ¼ller: What is going on Hunter 2-1?

Ivan: **Cough cough cough** They blew the Blyating bridge!

MÃ¼ller: ScheiÃe! Are you ok?

This occurred mere seconds after MÃ¼ller was loaded away from oregon to Califurnia.

(Audio Recording Begins)

Alright soldiers. Im wounded. Im weakend. And Iâm back in the frying pan. The furries are still in Chula Vista. Somehow, some furres acquired intel of my evacuation from Oregon to Califurnia. A convoy came to try and get us while driving. We held them off, but I was shot in the leg and stomach. I need help. Get the gamers to Chula Vista where my safe house is located. I need backup soon. Remember soldiers. Just because Iâm down doesnât mean Iâm out. Good luck and make sure to secure Chula Vista iin the name of Cheif.

Well Lieutenant. Apparently âHow the hell did you get hereâ is formal for you. I wonder what the village would think. I wonder what the furries will think. I wonder what the gamers will think. I wonder what Asriel would think. You are a really useful asset. Well when your not secretly filing me with tape recorders thatâs when. Now gimme tha-

7days gamers. Seven days.

Thanks for rescuing me comrades. Everybody who took place in the operation has been promoted to the next rank. Danke.

A speech MÃ¼ller gave shortly after the tragic death of Billious:



I have recently been notified that Billiousofthevoidhands has been killed by furries in a town in Britain. Ambushed by furries! The same people who killed his adopted son without reason! The same people who burned alive a 10 year old prince! These fuckers have just brought upon tragedy and suffering upon us! This reminds me of an incident back in February. A furry name Forepaw was sickened by the ways of furries torturing gamers and transformation. He started small protests during the peace time, and soon had protesters with him. Furry command realized this and decided to take action. When no furry February began, they started protests. Saying it was best to end the misery of captured gamers instead of torture and transform them. They eventually moved into town square. And furries hidden in buildings of the military with AKs, M16s, M4s, or whatever rifle they had, turned off the safety, cocked the loaded weapon, and fired into the crowd. All the furries were killed in that massacre including forepaw! He was a great man. Killed by tyrants! The event was so secret, even the leaders of the furries, Majira Strawberry didnât even know about the incident. These same fuckers have now burned a suffering man! Suffering from the fate of his loved ones! A generation wiped out! HE WAS A GREAT MAN! SLAUGHTERED BY TYRANTS! THESE FURRIES MUST DIE FOR THEIR SINS UPON MANKIND! THIS IS THE ENEMY WE FACE EVERY DAY! WE SHALL NO LONGER BE APPRESSED! I DECLARE AN OPERATION IN THE NAME OF BILLIOUS TO FINALLY TAKE BACK THOSE LANDS THAT WERE OURS! So gamers. Tyrants, or gamers? You decide.

=== August 19th ===
I think I can control my polandball side a little better. Now I can change to Germanyball whenever I please! Of course I still have some problems controlling âthe other sideâ. Nothing important today.

=== September 12th ===
Well a hell of a lot of wild events occurred these past few weeks. Kicked Charaâs ass in the Battle of the corrupted mind. We got bombing raids going on in Berlin as we speak. Well as I write. As we keep going through the years, I now feel different than the measle Lieutenant I was in June. Now, I feel like a part of this community. Like I mean something. Itâs as if I belong here. Also throughout the war furries have become less of a problem as ourselves. I swear another civil war is coming. People like spirit don't stop. I Wonder what itâs like in those lands of the cursed where no freedom lives under the furry tyranny.

=== September 22nd ===
Well the raid was rather a celebration and we finally took back Deutschland! We are also currently charging Middleafrika as I write. But I need to get out of this prison and get my head back in the game. Somebody seriously send in some backup please.

=== May 9th 2020 ===
I have recovered this old journal of mine. I donât think Iâll update it much longer. Itâs got dust in itâs pages at this point. These archives might be important though... This book will go in a museum once we are finished with it.

"I was now in the chair of ultimate power of controlling everything in my fingertips, and at this day forward this nation is going to be expanding its trade, security and the significance of the quality of life to our fellow citizens.The name of what was once a rebel battalion; now a republic, named as the OOFRF will be continuing on its improvements on this beautiful nation. And I now stand here to create and to promise all citizens for the desire of a better life for all and a better security for relief and the awe of new technology; this is a new era that must transform into a greater dynasty of the future."

Bill 001 has passed; a bill about creating weapons and technology program and the increase in military spending; with the use of USGR and USSR equipment.

Experimental OOF grenades have been approved for standard military use for the 70th iLiberation and the 1st OOF Armored Division.

Sent in my 1st Amphibious Division to Pointe au Baril in Canada and still waiting for new intel to come...

=== June 19, 2019 ===
"I am now concerned over the loss of tradition of our ROBLOXian culture has been taken over by the spread of anime and gacha indoctrination, this epidemic of assimilation will not be tolerated of our preserved lifestyle in here as a peaceful nation of the OOFRF. I now declare the creation of Bill 002: to embargo ANY anime or gacha literature. Under NO circumstances this immorality of our culture will be allowed or to be used in any way possible. They must be burned until the dissipation of this disease is completely dispersed. Our culture must be preserved as long as we can, from ancestor to ancestor; to noob abed guest abed baconhair. Every ROBLOXian must know and acknowledge our traditions that glued our society together that is based on that. Anyone who obtains any literature connecting anime or gacha content will forcibly have their items burned and pillaged and to be sentenced over such a heinous crime; via torture and ''"Last oof"'', and anyone who attempts or is attempted to become a 'weeb' or a 'gacha' must be sent to exile to contain our culture that acts as a pillar to our society. OUR roots of OUR culture must be preserved and acknowledged to know the history of our starting point and the uniqueness of each and every ROBLOXian culture and achievements that we have innovated."

=== June 20, 2019 ===
"Of what I have heard from the 1st OOF amphibious unit, they have cleared in buildings and strongholds in Pointe Au Baril. At this day victory shall claim ours very soon, and for the greater good of the future."

=== June 21, 2019 ===
Alright, I have a furry nanosuit in the weapons' lab and to see what is this thing. Oh, also I see a manga transport ship burning in flames as it is retreating... Ok I need to contact the leader or president or whatever of the weebs here, just give me a phone call...

=== June 22, 2019 ===
"From this day, Pointe Au Baril was a successful assault. Many were liberated and the furry transport has been narrowed down, we all thank for the soldiers participating in the assault. And we mourn for those who died with honor during the battle. Hopefully, this gruesome and a brutal war will be over soon for the better of our future."

MoistBlockhead also enforced Bill 002 by sending in troops at civilian docks to hijack manga transport vessels, kidnap and incarcerate weeaboo shipping crew to drastically reduce anime content coming in

"Man, the weeaboo diplomats are SO inconsistent. And they better respond to my OOFing phone call or many measures have to be OOFing made... I'm starting to have a suspicious feeling of those weebs...."

Seems like more weapons from the USSR are coming in, state of the art T14 Armatas. I'm assuming that babushka will be proud of the motherland's innovations.

"The Operation Oregon Dreams seems like an offensive that I will never forget, perhaps Noobatta will gladly oblige assuming that he hasn't been in a war for a very long time since Independence...."

=== June 25, 2019 ===
"For my troops from the 70th iLiberation Army, I pay you with the highest of my respects for each and every one of you. The ones surviving from the great conflict of our independence, I know you will all succeed of what you have already achieved from the past and will never flater of my behalf. This great war will be a nostalgia for you of what war is actually like, and I thank you for your participation to protect and serve for what is right and what is good. For OUR country and for the gamers, and for the future."

"Hmm, after thinking long and hard about this unprecedented event I have come in terms of banishing Bill 002 and converse the leader of the Kyotian Empire; Chidori and I will discuss matters to solve and recover relations between the entirety of the gamers and the ROBLOXians. Oof to you all."

=== July 1, 2019 ===
<nowiki>*</nowiki>drinks bloxy cola* "Ahhh, what a beautiful day it is to sit back and enjoy the view of the metropolitan setting... "Also seems like Noobatta's archives really do deserve the Bighead medal..."

=== July 2, 2019 ===
"Well, finally the summit is over. You know, after talks with Chidori we sorted things out of the anime embargo. I have released manga merchants in custody, no physical injuries, and of course the money to repair a burning manga transport vessel that my patrol troops bombed the oof out of it... Welp, I guess that marks another history."

=== July 4, 2019 ===
Yes, Project "Headrow" is finally done. The state of the art jet; the OA-1 jet, well not actually done... Still in prototype testing but the results seems to be very impressive in all-around use: reconnaissance, Air to air and air to ground combat. Can't wait to have my first military expo that is upcoming."

=== July 5, 2019 ===
"Hmm, now that there are furry advertisements and propaganda in OUR soil and OUR land. We must create strict measures about this, and make sure we do it properly unlike the last time we assaulted and burned a manga transport ship, kidnap and torture manga merchants.... Well you know what I mean. I guess fabricating Bill 003 will be an appropriate time to do it."

=== July 8, 2019 ===
"Ok, the gamer military expo is in two weeks. Better get my pilot aces to get training and get it good. Hopefully they will be the next competition of the 68th 'SWOL' squadron in the flying airshow because darn they are OOFing good to create the impossible. Someday even better; who knows? Also it seems that the unit is almost reaching the location...I'm really counting on Noobata again to do this, it's been a while since he's done a 'black ops' diversion terrorization. "

=== July 14, 2019 ===
At last... The "Headrow" is in full production and furbished. Another modernization step to success, and hopefully to beat the 'SWOL' Squadron in the USGR Airshow...

"What the heck!? There are so much anime games in Robloxia... I thought I signed a contract to Chidori where anime culture and transport is suppose to be limited."

<nowiki>*</nowiki>General Biggerhead arrives*

"Sir, major reports have been coming in. Brickbattler culture has been 45% assimilated in the far east via anime terrorism. Members are identified as part of a weeaboo terrorist group; numbers strong as 120,000 approximately"

"*sigh* I do NOT want to lose any of our men in this pointless incident. Might as well ask AAPenguin to send some of its armoured and special units in the frontlines... Also is it funded by the Weeb Empire?"

"Intelligence Agency is still working on that... But so far we do not have any clues yet. Adding to the situation we are in, anime advertisement as well as furry propaganda has reached into our public media."

"*bangs on the table* And it all happened on one day?!"

"Apparently..."

"Ok, this is so OOFing extreme. We have to take bold, but not extreme measures yet. But for now our first step is to blacklist ALL furry media ad propaganda and some anime advertisement to reach in our nation and to increase security units all around the area.

"Uh.. About contacting AAPenguin-"

"What about him?"

"Perhaps you can send an arms contract to the clan for increased security and increased revenue."

"But they are a splinter cell organization from the Gamers, who knows what are they going to do anytime. Besides I already gave them city blueprints, materials and food."

"Hm. Alright then, let's think about how is this going to work..."

[Video resumed to the meeting, Builderman House; OOFRF, 9:10 A.M.| Rep. Headrow, Baconhair, Gen. Brickbattler and Biggerhead and PR MoistBlockhead in setting]

"Hmmm. Of what the Intelligence Agency can find, seems like we found clues that they have been funded by a private anime corporation; but not the Weeb Empire itself."

"Then we'll destroy that OOFing corporation!"

"We can't do that here, it'll be a war crime to massacre defenseless workers. It's not like the olden days of robloxia in fact this is an outside threat that we are talking about."

"..."

"Either way fellow Robloxians, their numbers are engrossed but their firepower is limited; besides we have the Anti Anime Clan commencing the assault sooner or later. And a change of mind, I will send the 7th OOF air force to provide support at the ground. Perhaps it's time to use some of the ROFL copters and Russian equipment to be competent."

"Hmm."

"Hmm."

"Hold on a second isn't Cheese and Dory, or whatever her name is, are funding the corporation that are funding the terrorist in any form?"

"Typical Baconhair... Always making wild assumptions, but although it's somewhat possible for that occurrence. Also her name is 'Chidori'. Anyway, I'm pretty sure that they are not involved in all this."

"Ok, let's sort this mess through..."

"Fellow brickbattlers, let us start the order of business. Furry doctrine is spreading ALL around ROBLOXia, despite the fact that we have blacklisted and censor furry media to the public. I believe that the Countryhumans have shown involvement on propaganda in an attempt to reach out to us and to the rest of the world. Declaring war on them is one simple and a small step, but would significantly lower down USF morale. Any questions or suggestions."

"Ah yes, you know of what I have seen in the USGR news, the DRP are really trying to hold back on the pressure of the attrition caused by the Countryhumans, but as stated by the PR, declaring war on them would be the best course of action while the Gamers and the rest are busy doing their own military operations."

"Any more suggestions?"

It is time to for what is best for us and the good of our people, furry media is brainwashing people inside OUR borders. But despite that, they managed to hack into our censorship and I find it really disgusting of finding furry parodies mocking us and to promote such deliberate assimimilation. That is all. Any last words in this meeting, anyone."

"Heh, no wonder why mobilization of the countryhuman troops are quick and convenient. Pretty dumb to say as I do say so myself."

We did it, I made a cure

=== June 11, 2019 ===
I have done more research on Scalies and I think I figured out how to protect the brain from the infection to varying levels of protection.

the treatment is to listen to a legendary British rock band; QUEEN for a few hours every week.

I discovered this after one of those Scalie bastards bit me 3 times about 2 months ago the only sign this ever happened is a darker scalier texture around the bite wounds it still is spreading but my mind hasn't degraded (yet) and it should have about a month ago, like (Redacted) was when we got ambushed by a Scalie redacted said he never listened to queen. before the war i would hear it a lot on the radio (simpler times). I was by his side to try and help him. but he was doomed, as he progressively got worse until he became a "anthro-dragon-demonspawn-hellcreature" monstrosity, and he bit me but not before I uppercut him which sent him off balance, where I curb stomped him as hard as humanly possible. I used a broken piece of glass to cut [F] in his chest to pay respects, he was a really good friend of mine for a long time. I will try to avenge him, even If my body is fully infected I will blow those mofo's away. I hope to capture a few for research.

=== June 25, 2019 ===
my face Is now unrecognizable from the infection my upper back has gotten painful at night there is what I think the beginning of a tail. my mind still hasn't degraded at all which is quite unusual. (see previous log)

the furries have finally found me. (renegade by Styx intensifies) and they are forcing me to me a chemical that turns us gamers Into furries they forced me to drink it and after 24 hrs, the time it takes for it to exit the body furries did urine sample. (not cool) I made the exact concoction one of the furries chugged it down and a few hrs later I was held at gunpoint they asked me what I put in there and I said "what?" a brand new gamer walks in and says "I used to be infected! thx m8" I was a little confused at first then I added 2 and 2, and realized that he was the one that chugged the concoction down like a legend, and I had just realized I may have just found a cure, but again it could be like the glowing goo. I have the recipe:

1 snek scale

boiling water

citric acid

2 types of edible plant matter

vitamin C rich juice

stir until it turns pink.

more tests needed. requesting furry prisoners. plz

=== June 29 2019 ===
went to comic con made two new friends/recruits

saw a family of furries, I overheard the furries call it the "uwu virus" they also have some weird ritual that involves the uninfected's consent that involves both parties chanting "ONE OF US, ONE OF US" until the uninfected party is absorbed by the furry's party. it scares me

I saw an old friend he is doing well.

still waiting on request.

"Corporal, is there any news to know about?"

"Well sir, it seems that spies from a neighboring country are visiting us."

"Do you have a clue what the "neighboring country" Is?

"Oder league."

"Seems strange. We had conflicts during the last few months. They seem uninterested in raiding us again, Are they just land hungry?"

"Sir, there is something more important." (draws out files.)

(looks)

"Apparently they have a base that is called Osfront. PLANTED IN OUR SOIL.

(reading)

"I guess we should attack before it upgrades into base."

Regiment? On me.

"Hm, they seem to be normal ODer infantry."

"Alright, sergeant Go to the left and rain the OOF Molotov's when squadron 6 rains hell upon the base."

"Corporal, Take Squadron six and rain hell upon them."

(3...2....1) "Fire!"

Squadron six fires bullets into the fort, awhile Squadron 8 rains real hell upon the base.

(Inside of Osfront)

"H-hello! anybody there?"

"I need forces at osfront! Now-"

(crumbling)

"Sir the forces are overwhelming us, they're attacking at every angle!"

"Keep firing, we'll get contact with reinforcements soon!"

(sergeant looks around)

"Hold on longer! you'll make it."

"I-I-I don't feel o-okay."

(wrapping)

"I-I cant g-get up.."

(front wall crumbles down)

"Gah! (covers himself and client.)

"I-I see no peace... I just see war all these days."

"Hold fire!"

"Everyone in the fort, get out in 10 seconds!"

"Good."

"Do you really surrender?" (pointing gun at commanding NCO)

"Yes."

"Alright, take them into the POW camp, get the wounded patched up."

Well its been a while scence i recorded one of these. Unfortunately every time i try to record one Matrix takes it and eats it. I dunno why. So i have been feeding it blank cassette tapes along with its normal diet. Anyway. I have been preforming tests on Matrix and I have reseaved the fallowing information.

Very Extreme Cold Weather can cause it to freeze solid for a moment. But no more.

Heat seems to be its weakness as too much heat can cause it to melt which results in it returning into the jar to cooldown for a period of time.

It seems to be uneffected by toxic smells, radiation.

Feeding it hot peppers will cause it to have brief fire breath

Feeding it Ice cubes will cause it to transfer the ice to cover a part of its body which might result in a hard hitting attack.

It tried to eat a stone. it then after trying to eat it spat it out hard enough to make a hole right through my 3 layer titanium enforced base, I then found the stone 3 miles away when I was scouting.

In summary. Matrix to me is...actually kind of sweet and kind. Like a pet. I learn a lot about it every day and it learns about the environment each day.

Thats all for now. Im going to upload this log before Matrix tries to gobble up this tape. piece out!

First being the Spidey suit MK-1. The first ever spiderman suit I made. Mostly Bullet proof, flexible, and webs up furry bitches like no tommorow. Athough there are only about 50 webs in each web shooter. Still, its a good suit and I hope to make more. Next up is a custom made R101c carbine. I combined multiple guns to make it. It fires a armor piercing Pistol and AR round. Very unique round that no gun has. Speaking of titans, I've made the first ever real titan. His code name is:T-1-M or Tim. He's a Monarch titan. I hope to make plenty of more cool stuff for you guys.I'm always around if you guys need me.

To anyone who finds this log. My men have been wiped out, my supplies cut off and resources depleted with no help coming, I have only a few rounds left, I am making my last stand. My last will and testaments is in my desk. *static for about 5 minutes* Damn recorder, is this thing working? Yes, good. This will be my last entry for a while. If found this message is to be sent immediately to the following people: DapperSkull, GreatPondGames, President Hope, Nikostormkilla, Chiokill, ActiveAidan, Queen Fluer and Yeet, to those people IÂ say Goodbye. Goodbye Gamer Army, goodbye furries and goodbye to the listener of this. It has been a fun ride, it will be a miracle if I make it out of this alive.

This is Lt. Welsh signing off for what will probably be the last time.

Â  Â Ok, this should be recording. It has been a while, also, if my will has been read, I am taking it all back as I am not dead. I...I should start from the beginning. So following on from my last entry, they took out my communications centre, it was after this that I stumbled across an old tunnel under my house. I went through it and it took me straight to the next town over. I found an old safe house there which I stayed at and laid low for a while, then the Covid-19 pandemic hit. According to the official reports, I am dead. For the safety of my friends, family, comrades and myself, the records must remain that way, I must remain officially dead. I also require a shipment of sandwiches, nerf bullets, Cherryade and fruit pastels. The shipment address is '''[REDACTED]''', they must be sent in a large amazon delivery box as to not draw suspicion.''' '''I must go dark for the foreseeable future. For the final time in a while, good *an explosion is heard outside*... CRAP! They found me! Goodbye.

Â  Â Before I begin, here is some music to set the mood: https://youtu.be/OGnTwGxGN7g

Â  Â *recording begins*

Â  Â I have been locked in battle for a month, I have one bullet left, no grenades, no food, no weapons, no escape, no dreams, no hope. I remember the last time my situation was like this. It's bitter sweet, this is the way my first battle went, and now it is how my last battle is going. Am I scared of death? The answer is no. I have found peace with what I have done and I am at peace with myself. I welcome death, I have lived long enough. I have no escape, they are at every window and door and are attempting to get down the chimney and in through the basement, there are no secret tunnels this time. It is with great sadness that I now read my will. First to DapperSkull, I leave him my PC, mouse, keyboard and monitor. Next to GreatPondGames, I leave my collection of FNaF merch, art and games. To President...no, to Hope, my good friend, I leave my collection of Queen music and command of my force, the 12th Bloxxers Battalion. Now, I leave to Niko my office and the Â£200 in the safe under my desk. To Chiokill, I leave my first nerf gun, a Nerf Strongarm. Next, to Yeet, if your still alive that is, I leave my Wii console, games and controllers. Finally, to dragon, the one who converted to furry I leave a boot to the head. So, this is the end of my will, I thank those mentioned in my will for being there for me and being true friends, I also thank ActiveAiden (MIA) and Queen Fluer (KIA) for the same reasons, I will be meeting up with you soon, until then.

Â  Â This is Lieutenant Welsh, former commanding officer of the 12th Bloxxers Battalion, signing off for the final time. Hwyl Fawr(goodbye). *one lone gunshot and a thud is heard before the recording ends*

Bravo: Good god, didn't they say he had only one bullet left?

I terminated myself because I hold may confidential documents that could ruin the gamers come the next war, by terminating myself, it means that they will be lost forever. Please, do not be sad that I am gone, but rejoice that I had a life well lived and a life that was long and prosperous. Thank you, Lt. Welsh.

Hello, My name is Rocco Ramirez, I am recording in the log of Lt. Welsh because the following information is about him. The fur that was found in his office, the results just came in earlier today. Yes I know that a whole month is a long time. The results state that the DNA is similar to that of Lt. Welsh with the DNA of a wolf added. This should be impossible, right? That's what I thought. It turns out that the mourge never perfomed and autopsy on the body. The morgue staff onduty that day have been fired. We have looked into the CCTV and it was wiped when the breach happened. We are considering the following reasons: false DNA, Human error, organised attack. There is one more that has been declared classified on the Clandestine level. Anyone who accesses this data whithout the proper clearence will be terminated using a version of the BERRYMAN-LANGFORD memetic kill agent.

[[File:Kill Agent.jpg|none|thumb|253x253px|Kill Agent Activated]]
I'm assuming that if your still reading this then you have the proper clearance. Good, I'll continue. Firstly, thank you to the SCP republic for providance of the kill agent. Right, the classified reason for the breach is that we think that Welsh may have...faked his death. One of his men have reported seeing... I don't know if I should say this name or not. One of his men have reported seeing...Aleil. However it is only one. We do have reason to believe that Aleil has taken Welsh as her prisoner or worse, transfurred him. Both of these possibilities are deeply worrying because he was the only one who had the plans for a weapon that for the Gamer's is going to be the next best thing since sliced bread. If Aleil/the furries get hold of those plans, we may as well surrender. What is more worrysome is that the fact that from his office, a lockbox containing war plans and blueprints that are key to the Gamer's was stolen. Only Welsh has access to this box. We are having an autospy preformed on the body. This is all the info I have for now. Head of Security Ramirez signing off.

Ramirez: Hello, Ramirez again. I have the results of the autopsy on the body. ...The "body" is completely fake. It was full of sawdust, foam and polysytrene. We must assume that Welsh is still alive and out there somewhere. It is because of this we have activated executive order 76 under Torchwood directive 2 and the 456 regulations. MTF-T-65 have been activated to find him. His entire office has been cleared of anything of importance and has a guard posted outside. Anyone who may have an idea of where Welsh is has been brought in for interrogation. Anyone who may want to tell any of Welsh's secrets to the furries or enemy has been given a dose of Retcon. We are doing all we can to locate him and if he's out there, we'll find him. If anyone sees him on the street or in the wild, they are to call MTF-T-65. This is Ramirez signing off.

Hey gamers!

The reason I have not posted for two days is I have had some issuses that I will talk about. So, back at the rock shelter, I found many new things. Packs of medicene, guns, scratch marks on the rocks, and LOTS of art. The most interesting thing I found was a vile a odd liqud. It was the color of plasma goop, but much stickier. I accidentally spilled some on my leg, and the affects are worring me. I have wanted to rebel against the gamers, make animal noises, and last night, I found myself howling at the moon. (My furrsona is a wolf) It seems to be getting worse, but I have been watching lots of PewDiePie, which for now is working. My supply of Mountain Dew and Axe is low, so i'm not sure how much longer the videos will help. At the moment of writing this, I am on a train leading to HQ. I hope once I get back we may descover what the liquid is. Well, I guess thats all.

                                                                                                                                                               GamerOfFur, Out!

=== August 21, 2019 ===
Hey gamers!

Thanks to a air drop, full of Mountain Dew, from a fellow comrade, I am feeling much better. My furry urges are much more controled, and my sanity has been restored. The train ride to HQ took longer than I anticipated, because we had to stop for fuel. Yesterday, nothing happened but today... whoa... The town we stoped in was small but there was many factories. And the things I saw in the town were just....ugh. Slaves. I saw hundreds of furries on leashs, being pulled by men. I dont know if they were gamers, but it dos'nt matter. Still slaveory. Of course, when I saw them all, I put up my hood and and tucked my tail in. When I asked where they all came from, a man who had been leading them didn't tell me they were furries that wanted to kill all gamers. No, he said, and I quote, "Oh, this lot? *smirks* Got em' at a con. Roundin' em up was pretty tricky, the furfags!" FurFags... What a horrible name. Anyway, i digress. I went a shop and there was only bread, and the shop keeper said it was all they could afford to make. I would have helped but the train was about to leave. Well, im back at HQ, and i need to speak with someone.

Thats all! GamerOfFur, out!

=== August 23, 2019 ===
Welp, I'm gonna get arrested.

Hey, gamers!

I did it! I freeed them! Not with out setbacks, but I'll get into that. So, yesterday I got on a train from HQ, at around 4:30 A.M., I got off at the town at exactly 7:42. And the I waited. When midnight i went to as many slave houses as I could, and I timed it that I would be done around a half an hour later. That is when the train comes. The last house had lots of kids, which equals more noise, so we got caught. I was able to get them all on the train, but I couldn't get in as well. I ran through the woods, to get to another train station but many of the men chased me. One shot my hand, but I was able to get away. The train picked at the stop. My hand is feeling a little better now but.... My blood is the color of the stuff I spilled on myself in the rock shelter! Anyway, I got back to HQ at, like 4:25, and right now I am waiting for my hand to get checked out. About the arrested thing, is it illegal? To free slaves in that town I mean. And I did not get explicit permission from Chief so... Well, once I get the blood thing sorted, I am going to try and free more furries! I know it's risky, but it is what I must do.

Hey gamers!

I lot has happened recently. I fell from a helicopter, into the ocean. Had to get a heart surgery. Found out that I am Eliza Memus. I am Memus's daughter! And that's not even everything that happened! Anyway, I'm not going to talk about that. I need a break from it. So, yesterday I proposed a tracker that i would be able out on the furries that I free. So far, it as not gone anywhere, but I'll bring it up to everyone again soon. It would burrow in to the furries fur, and whenever they went somewhere we didn't want them to go, it might send off a small electric shock. I don't know yet. Well, yesterday I freed some slaves with someone I will not mention for privacy. I don't want to get into what I saw there. I am on a plane with my father while writing this, on our way to Ireland. There is something in early planing stages, but that's all I can say. Well that's all.

H-hey, gamers.

He's gone.... Really gone.... Father. I- last night was... I don't know, just so horrible. He was going to go to jail but then h-he killed himself. I just arived in Japan... and in his will, it, um, says Chidori is now my legal guardian. And, uh, apparently I have 50% of his money, which I will probably give to charity. I don't really know what comes next. Maybe more spying... I don't know. I am, uh, I am so proud to be Eliza Memus, and yeah, my father was not a saint. Heck, h-he was not even a good person, but still...just...I don't know why. And sorry I haven't been posting. I've given up on posting these constantly. I'll only write if s-something interesting happens. And I really didn't want to write this so... Tada. Audio log. I just wanted to thank everyone who has given me a life here. For, um, giving me something to fight for.

Well, GamerOfF-... Eliza, out...

=== September 2, 2019 ===

Hey, gamers!

Ok! This is going to be short. So, I was going to take a break but... nah, I'll rest when i'm dead. I was going to cross into furry teritory, when I saw a group of furries near a outpost. Around 25 of them. Right now, I am said outpost, and it seems they have stoped for the night. So, i'm gonna need some troops out here. At least 30, at the bourder in Pennsivlania. Sorry for the spelling. Im just scribleing this down.

Hey Gamers!

Life is weird here. My life has been fliped upside down, turned inside out, and has done about 10 loop-d-loops. But I'm not here to talk about that. I have learned something very important. I was spying and I was able to get into a base by knocking someone out and stealing there fursuit. When I got inside, they were making announcement, so I listened. Most of it was useless, except one thing. The speaker mentioned something called "Project Poison". Naturally, I investigated. When I entered the base's archive, I found the document. I will write what it said.

"Project Poison

Statis: Active

Makers: Section0

Client: |:|Redactied|:|

1. Take over all northeren Mountain Dew factiores: Done.

2. Put Substance OX in all cans: Done.

3. Make Propoganda: Done

4. Distrubute cans:

5. Release propoganda:

Substance OX is a blue goop that causes people to turn into furries. All humans and all creatures of the sort can be affected. One drop on skin causes furry urges. One drop in mouth will cause gamer to become furry in days. A large amount cause the gamer to instantly turn into a furry. If the Gamer's immune system is not strong enough, It will affect the heart and kill them. This will be executed on 9-12-19 at 10:00 p.m."

Remmeber when I spilled that blue stuff on me? Yeah, I think in know what it is now... Well, that's all I guess... And to all, do not drink any Mountain Dew for the next week or two!

=== September 25, 2019 ===

Hey gamers.

I... don't really know why I'm writing this. I just wanted to put this all down, clear my mind. Things have been a blur really. Ever since... Um, my fathers death, I think. I mean I'm pretty sure that's when things began to melt together. Events are being shuffled, I can't rember things, and I've noticed that my anxity attcaks are getting more freqent. After I escaped the furry fasilaty, I tried to pretend I didn't exist. Tried to cut myself of from the world and...... it didn't work. At all. I wanted to train, and I did. But not as much as I wanted. So..... Just wanted to write this.... Whoa... I just got really tired. Well, Bye.

GamerOfFur, out.

=== September ??, 2019 ===

Hey gamers.

It's gotten worse. Things are getting cloudy... I can't remember what I did yesterday. Putting names with faces is becoming hard. The worst thing... I don't even know my last name anymore. I know bad things have been happening, but I can't rember what they were. I have panic attacks all the time. Since when did I have those? Can can bearly remember anything after.... I don't know when it started, really. I know im a gamer. I know I have friends. I can't remember who though....The thing is.... I don't really care. I can't find a reason to be worried honestly. And thats what scares me. I in a building in the woods. Reading the sign over the door, I'm at a outpost. This will probably get worse. I won't even know who I am tomorrow. But i couldn't care less. Sorry if things are spelled wrong.

GamerOF.... Right, GamerOfFur, out.

=== September 29, 2019 ===

Hey gamers!

I'm back and feeling much better! Anyway, I was out in the woods camping, (I had free time) when this flyer on the ground caught my attention. It says, and I quote, "Come to the meeting of the Society of High Gamers for a new prospective on hybrids." I t listed some coordinates that were not far from where I was, and since I'm a hybrid myself, I got curious. When I got to the listed coordinates, it was a outpost. But there was a banner on the side with the hybrid symbol with a red x on it. I'm putting on a ball cap and tucking my tail in right now. I'm going in and I will right more when I leave. Wish me luck....

GamerOfFur, out!

=== October 10, 2019 ===

Hey gamers!

My life just turned for the better. I'm living with my father on a island and am learning how to invent thing for gamers. Remember that thing about the gamers hating hybrids? Yeah , they were just some drunk, very patriotic gamers. Well, I don't know what I'm going to do next. I think I may continue Project Freedom by myself. It was that thing that would allow furry slaves to be free, but also be watched by gamers. I know this is just paranoia talking, but... Everything is to good to be true. I'm with my dad, out of danger but still helping gamers. All I've ever wanted. It's probably nothing, but I can't help but feel uneasy some times. Welp, that about sums everything up.

GamerOfFur, out!

=== October 22, 2019 ===

Hey gamers!

Sorry I haven't been active in a while, the rocket I'm building is just taking up a lot of of time. Anyway, I have got test subjects for Project Freedom and the rocket is almost finshed , so everything is going quite smoothly. But that's not why I'm writing this. Somethings wrong. More specifically, there is something on this island. Not furry, gamer, animal, or anything in between. Just a entity. I do don't know what it is yet, but it leaves behind a goop , like from Ghost Busters, where ever it goes. I'm not sure my dad is aware it is here, but um... It's not causing any problems or any damage, so it seems harmless enough. For now. More on Project Freedom, the devices are working perfectly! Whenever a subject goes into an area that I have not programmed into it, it will give them a small shock. Not big enough to hurt, but to just stun them for a second or two. Note that all of them agreed to this. Well, that's all.

GamerOfFur, out!

=== December 14, 2019 ===

There we are! Oh, uh, this is Eliza and some amazing just happened! But first, I'm excited to say that Project Freedom is a go! You would think there would be no furry slaves now that the war is over, but you would be surprised. There is over 10 thousand furries slaves across America, and I'm gonna help as many as I can. Back to the amazing thing.

=== January 1, 2020 ===

Hey Gamers!

Whoo who! New year, New chief, and a new chapter in my life! What is this new chapter, you may ask. Today I'm officially starting Project Freedom! A quick summary of what that Is. I've always been disgusted with how there is still slavery in this country, so I promised myself that I would do something about it. Tonight, I'm going to head out to West Virginia and free furry slaves. I made a devise that I will give the furries once they are freed. It's placed behind the ear and gives them an electric shock if they attack a gamer. It will also shock them if they go to a place that I have programmed the devise to not let them go. Even though the furry war is over, we wouldn't want them turning on us. Presid- Chief Final Hope gave me some advice, which I used. It identifies the furry and does a background check on them. If the were born into slavery, were pulled into it for no reason, or were furry soldiers and committed no crimes, I would give them the device and they would go free. But, if they have committed war crimes or have done something illegal, I will leave them in the hands of law enforcement. I don't know what I'm getting my self into, but I have made plans. I have done thorough research on three slave camps. Guard times and locations, layouts and where everyone is at a certain time. Well I suppose that's all. Wish me luck!

GamerOfFur, out!I

ME: Beggining of the year, new chances to do whatever I want. I don't know why, but I was recruited to watch this group of Furries.

I gotta say, I don't really like Furries, they draw weird things and dress like colorful giant animals.

RYKER: Dude, shut up. We were commanded to be here, and you might blow our cover.

STEWIE: They're on the move.

-Furries enter an abandoned orphanage-

RYKER: Now, won't this be a ride?

ME: How so?

RYKER: Weren't you in one of these?

ME: I wouldn't mind not talking about that part of my life

DAN: Suit yourself, but please shut up before we lose those Furries.

-We climb the orpahange and enter through a broken window

HAL: Wow this place is a mess

RYKER: Shush, there they are

-The Furries seem to be just chatting-

RYKER, TO A RADIO: Commander, they're just chatting, you've wasted our time

COMMANDER, THROUGH THE RADIO: BULLSHIT! (this is how I learned one of my favorite words, btw) Those Furries are up to something.

STEWIE: They're just chatting

COMMANDER: They are hiding something...They've probably already spotted you

RYKER: With FK's big mouth, that's really probable.

FURRY #1: He's right, you guys, and we'd like you to stop following us.

MIKE: And the shit just hit the fan.

JHONSON: What now?

ME: I got this, bros.

-aims Sniper and Furries cower in fear-

RYKER: -takes Sniper from me- Dude what the actual fuck?

ME: I thought it was appropriate

RYKER: NO! Use this instead

-starts shooting Furries with an SMG-

-everyone joins in and the Furries all die-

COMMANDER: Tell me you didn't just kill them.

STEWIE: That would be lying to you, sir

COMMANDER: Fuck.

=== November 27th, 2018 ===
ME: Ok, so... war, huh?

RYKER: Yea...

HAL: Oh come on, it isnt that bad, we finally have a reason to kill

STEWIE: Idk man, I have family waiting for me, you know?

HAL: That sounds like a "you" problem

DAN: Dude, what is wrong with you, Hal?

RYKER: Yea, keep in mind we can shoot you at any given time

JHONSON: Actually, you would become a war prisoner for treason, but, yea, be nicer, Hal

HAL: I don't have to, don't pretend you are nice, this is a war, we are murderers at this point. Hell, we are going on a mission to assassinate a Furry leader!

-silence-

HAL: Yea, I thought so.

=== September 2, 2020 ===
Now you may be wondering: Why did I fail to liberate Buffalo? Why is Curtis now blind? Why did Ryan dissappear? Why did you fail your former home? Here in this blog post I will tell you why. Most context comes from Discord. If you're like Chan and don't have Discord, I'll tell it here.

With the Alt Furries taking over New York, their enemies (Democratic Gamer Republic, RSEL, The 5th Reich, New Soviet-Canadian Union, New Spain, Alameda Country, SCP Republic, The Crimson Fleet, United States of Furries) fought back. Progress was being made and places like the Bronx were taken back. That was the city I tried to help out with, but it was taken back already. I decided to go help the city of Buffalo, a place I had lived in for a few years when I was younger. I also volunteered to help out resistance and guerilla groups in the area. 

So I got in a car (not stolen) and drove to a dock, and sailed Athol Springs. There I saw a man crouching, in SWAT armor with a Glock 18, ready to shoot me. I told him that I was not an Alt, and that I came to help. He holstered his gun, and believed me. Though he was still skeptical. 

We decided to walk to Buffalo ourselves. However, on the way, an car with a resistance group that helped the Alts saw us, and were suspicious of us. They told us to surrender, but the officer (who I now knew as Curtis) and I foolishly retaliated by firing at the car, I thought we had possibly killed 2 of the 9 occupants. We  ran from the scene retreating into an abandonded motel. The car seemed to follow us and wait. 

We immediately barricaded and locked all doors and windows. They waited for what have felt like hours, before they pulled out. Given how they didn't give further action, I thought we didn't kill any of the occupants. But to make sure we walked right into a trap, we escaped from a window in a more remote area. Then we walked for about another 2 miles, when what appeared to be a helicopter zoomed by, I immediately knew this was Ryan's helicopter, it looks exactly like it. Somehow, he saw us, and gave us a quicker ride to Buffalo. 

When we got there, I thought he fooled us, and instead took us to Detroit; because it was a terrifying scene. There was burning metal on the ground everywhere, and some stuff a little disturbing to describe. This worried me, because another reason I came here was to rescue my son, George. Knowing that a helicopter was going to worry the Alts, we immediately got out, and Ryan left. There a fight between Alts and a resistance group was going on, and we decided to help the resistance. We helped fight back until night came, advancing about 3 miles; that's when the tide turned. Three groups of few alt soldiers came with full on gear and smoke grenades.  

They threw one at our direction and landed smack at Curtis, causing his skull to chip, and the smoke grenade opened right next to him. I grabbed him, and signaled for Ryan to come back, but I got no response. At this point, I had to defy the law. I, Curtis, and a few others got in a pickup truck and drove out of the city to Canada. When we got to Canada, I got out and performed CPR on Curtis, and I could hear a heartbeat. But he was still not moving, so we drove him to a hospital. This was a failure, my son George is still stuck in the city, overrun with chaos. Ryan has gone missing, if you see him or his helicopter, contact me immediatly.

This is my account. Signing out.

=== September 4 (Night) ===
It is the nighttime of September 4, Buffalo and the rest of New York state is liberated. I have retired for the day in a hotel in Newark, New Jersey. It will be a few weeks before my marriage with Emma will come, and I have found my son George. But at the moment, all I can do is rest. That is when I hear the voices of two men, and a woman. They have something large on them, it is clinking, and they are stepping right in front of my door. They knock vigorously, with the woman saying: "Good evening sir, this is hotel room attendance." Why the hell are they knocking on my door at this time? My room is on "Don't Disturb" Mode, are they blind? I go to look from the peephole, and see what I had just described to you. They somehow managed to get a master key, as they use it to open my locked door. Then I get a full view of the three people. And they were carrying with them a Minebea PM-9! I was fucking scared, they then closed the door, which they locked. I tried not to panic, as for they could respond with firing at me right there, plus I had lured them into a trap. They took me too the bathroom, and one of the men said: "Nolan Chiang, you shall be rightfully punished for your crimes against Empress Chidori Lulz, and her empire. My name is Yoichi Anji. This other man is Albert Smith. This lady is REDACTED." Well that was the stupidest thing he could've said, but I think he the mindset that the mission would be a complete success. They then closed the door, and when they were loading the gun, that's when the trap was triggered. I kicked Yoichi in the jaw, knocking him onto the ground, and smashed Albert into the toilet. REDACTED tried to fight back by trying to pull something out, but I couldn't see it because I took her hostage with the Minebea. There, the two injured men looked as I told to surrender. But Yoichi pulled out a box cutter, I told him to drop it but he didn't comply, so there he went. Albert probably was in a critical condition, so I decided to call an ambulance. The lady stated that she was forced, but to be safe I had her go with police. Turns out she was innocent. It's very likely the hitmen were lying, and were just murderers finding an excuse to try and bump me off, so take their words with a pinch of salt. 

This is Nolan, signing out again.

So today is the first day of No Nut November. However, it was recently announced that President Trump was assassinated by Furries. I hope this doesnât escalate any further but until then, Iâll be making my sandwiches in the kitchen as I am told by my superiors.

=== November 10, 2018 ===
Well. Itâs official. The war has begun. And the Furries have gained New York. Iâve heard that theyâre making it their capital. Iâll be trying to advocate for Gamer Girls to join in this war but Iâll also do my job in the kitchen, for my fellow Gamer Boys depend on me for nutrients. Also, the Gamers manage to take Florida from the Furries.

The 64th Gamer Infantry Division is created. Due to my many successful missions, I was given an offer to join the division. And I took it.

See here for all of the 64thâs missions (WIP): https://gvf-war.fandom.com/wiki/64th_Gamer_Infantry_Division?useskin=oasis#Battles

=== April 19, 2020 ===
Unlike the other missions, this one was different. For this mission, we were sent to the border between Texas and Mexico. Thatâs where I saw those poor immigrants, having to live in a rundown camp between the U.S. and Mexico while waiting for their visas. And it wasnât just then men. But the women. And the children too. It was extremely heartbreaking for me, but I managed to keep it on the inside. When night came, so did the gangs. Apparently, they were the only supply route the immigrants knew, since the UGR seemed to have forgotten them completely. Of course, they wouldnât be as merciful as you would hope. Lucky, we managed to defeat the gangs and protect the immigrants. However, the image still haunts me to this day.

=== April 20, 2020 ===
Feeling bad for the immigrants, I decided to go to the border, where the former president proposed his wall would be. Thatâs where I found a bunch of guards protecting some closed off area. I only managed to convince a few of my soldiers to join me. Because of this, I was forced to call a bounty hunter I had heard of. Her name was Dime. She lived in Japan by she took jobs from anywhere around the world. Iâm glad she accepted the job I offered her. When it was night, we sneaked into the area that was originally blocked off. When we got deep inside, I saw something that I had only seen in images prior to this. Children in cages. It was just as heartbreaking as the photos made it out to be, if not more. We managed to free them, but not before security saw what we were doing. We managed to kill them all and Dime took the immigrants back with her to Japan, where I can only assumed they had a better life. Of course, some of the children had to sleep on the floors while others got very good treatment. Regardless of this, they were still separated from their families. I hoped I could make enough time to search for them. However, I seemed to have gotten my wish.

=== April 21, 2020 ===
I was later convicted of my crimes and forced into exile. Before leaving, I gave one last goodbye to my general, Orange Biker. It was a bittersweet moment, but at least it was a consequence of doing the right thing.
