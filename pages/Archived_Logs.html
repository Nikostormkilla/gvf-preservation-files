== Sgt. West's Log (Archive) ==

=== January 22nd, 2019===

Hello Gamers, this is Sgt. West reporting from the eastern theater with a special first installment of my log, Today we have a report from a soldier who witnessed the start of this bloody conflict, I will keep my source anonymous as I believe he has gone through enough... brace yourselves:

''I was there. It was a normal day on patrol. We stood our ground, looking around for any attackers. But we never anticipated the ambush. All of a sudden, a furry lunged at Kenvil, grabbing his feet and tickling it violently. Me and my comrades were unable to help. We could only watch as our friend Kenvil succumbed to the torture. I couldn't take it anymore. I cocked my nerf blaster and shot that wicked furry right in the head, blowing it to bits. Little did I know that what just happened would start a war.''﻿

And that's how this began. We believe the bastard who started it was from sector 63. We also have a special report of intercepted transmissions from a furry spy, unfortunately my team and I haven't been able to find the identity the traitor but we know what communications have been made. Here it is:

''TO FURRY HIGH COMMAND, ''

''I HAVE INFILTRATED THE EASTERN RUSSIAN FRONT. I HAVE MANAGED TO STEAL THE PLANS AND REPLACE THEM WITH A FAKE. CURRENTLY FIVE CLICKS SOUTHEAST OF MOSCOW. ENCOUNTERED GAMERS, BUT FENDED THEM OFF. FIVE MILES NORTH OF EVAC POINT. CODE NAME COBAIN''

If you have any info on Cobain, please share it with my squad. Till then, this is Sgt. West, signing off.

=== January 22nd, 2019 cont.===

ENTRY 2:

Hello Gamers, this is Sgt. West with more info on the mysterious Cobain. My squad has collected three more pieces of info. here they are:

''TO FURRY HIGH COMMAND, PUTNAM IS PLANNING A REVOLUTION. ESTIMATED 300 TROOPS. BRING SOMETHING TO PREVENT THE REVOLUTION. CODE NAME COBAIN''

''TO FURRY HIGH COMMAND, BELOW IS AN INTERCEPTED MESSAGE FROM THE PHILIPPINES. IT MAY PROVE CRUCIAL TO GAIN THAT SECTION: THIS IS THE GAMERS FROM THE PHILIPPINES. FURRIES ARE BASICALLY INVISIBLE DUE TO SNAKE FURRIES. WE ARE MAKING SLOW PROGRESS BUT WE HAVE RUN OUT OF FORTIFICATION SUPPLIES. WE RESTORED THEM BY CUTTING TREES, BUT THIS MAKES US VULNERABLE. NORTHERN LUZON IS CUT OFF DUE TO SABOTAGE. HALF OF MANILA IS DOING WELL. THE SOUTH IS OCCUPIED BY GAMERS WHILE THE NORTH IS OCCUPIED BU FURRIES. CEBU HAS BEEN LIBERATED BY THE GAMERS. PUTANGINAKA132 MINDANAO AS A WHOLE IS STILL UNCONFIRMED BECAUSE OF NOOBS (NOOBS ARE MAKING THIS REALLY HARD ON US!). ALL AND ALL, WE'RE DOING GREAT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL WE WILL WIN, AND ASSASSINATE OUR ANONYMOUS COMMANDER. CODE NAME COBAIN''

''TO FURRY HIGH COMMAND, BLOCKADE NEEDED AROUND THE PHILIPPINES. SUPPLIES ARE LOWERING FOR GAMERS. PLAN TO SEND A SUPPLY CRATE. MAKE SURE TO INTERCEPT IT. THEY PLAN TO LAUNCH THE DROP SHIP AT 01500 HOURS TODAY. PASS ALONG. CODE-NAME COBAIN''

That is all the info we have for now, until next time this is Sgt. West, signing off.

Hello Gamer Boys, my name is Women729473. I work in the food industry in the war, making sandwiches for the soldiers partaking in this war, for they have my highest respect. Me and many other women who stay in the kitchen work endless hours to provide for the Gamers. Recently some women have noticed a slight shortage in this bread. After the loss of retard hill, things haven’t been the same, and some weaker hearted women have almost given up hope in our winning on this war. We haven’t given up yet. Anyways, let me get back to the point, I don’t want to waste your training time. I noticed that after hours of making sandwiches that they would all just go missing! This, of course, isn’t good. I know I’m not supposed to cross boundary lines but it’s a risk I’m willing to take for our boys. I’ve uncovered a hidden tunnel, 20 feet below the surface, it goes from one of they furry training camps to our kitchens. We need backup immediately, we don’t know how long we have before they come back! Exports of sandwiches are going out soon and we’re down about 150 sandwiches minimum. The first Gamer Boy who finds this, please send backup! Thank you and good luck boys. May you have Lady Luck on your side, and to all of our fallen boys; May you forever have peace.

=== February 24, 2019 ===
in my research, i have intercepted a radio conversation between a furry commander and a furry high commander (only the high commanders name is mention). here is what i found...

"wake up, seroth!"

"what is it?"

"i have shocking news! in our recent losses, if we lose 10 more battles, we could lose the war!

"WHAT!! Where are we losing! Why are we losing!"

"well, do to the sheer man and meme power the gamers have, as well as the complete loss of Georgia, there has been an uproar in morale to gamers!"

"Call it in to HQ, they NEED to hear this! also execute plan F!"

"But sir, if we do that, our entire army could be killed!"

"I KNOW THAT!! But desperate times call for desperate measures!"

This is good news and bad news, if our troops morale gets higher, this war will be won. But the bad news is that the mention of "plan F". there is no mention of said plan in our captured furry Intel. I will have to look in to it. none the less, this is great news.

blessed be our new founding meme lords, a server reborn, may notch be with you all.

In New York, the conditions are extremely troubling. Most of the New York population had not heard of the brewing tension between the Gamers and Furries. When the war broke out, the Furries made quick gains against us. Neighbourhood by Neighbourhood. Street by street, inch by inch. As of right now, they've taken all of Suffolk and Nassau County. The current status of the rest of the state is unknown to me. My family has gone into hiding and I am staying here to fight the impending crack down. Although I do play video games, I have not decided which faction to join. Wish me luck. '''Bring Balance Back.'''

I ventured outside today to look for a makeshift weapon. I am currently using a Black Series Lightsaber, but it won't do. If there are any Soviets reading this: FURRY PROPAGANDA HAS BEEN FOUND. It may be offensive to you Soviets, so viewers discretion is advised.

=== November 17th, 2018 ===
I have not left my home yet, but I know I have to. The word is that there are other rebellious counties in New York. My goal is to help in the uprising. This is going to be difficult, but I know we can do it.

=== November 18th, 2018 ===
I am hiding inside of my home right now. Nobody has gotten to my neighbourhood yet, so I am arming myself as well as arming the neighbourhood I am leaving tomorrow. That is a fact.

==== 5:20 PM: ====
We were surprised. I though they wouldn't march into here until at least the 20th.

===May 19, 2019===

Upon further study of the stone containing Queen Chidori’s soul, we believed that the book that general Yeet has brought us, the supposed “book of the dead” could resurrect her. However within a few days of reading a few passages from the book directed towards the stone, nothing seemed to work. However the stone changed from a red color to pure black within 12 hours of opening the book. There is more activity within the stone, which we have only recently discovered. So much energy it’s as if there is more than one spirit in the stone itself. Upon further investigation we have noticed that some of the scientist become compelled to touch it or hold it, claiming it’s speaking out to them. When we try to hold them back from touching it, they become extremely violent, to the point where one scientist almost killed another for simply trying to talk him out of it. At this time it is unknown as to why the stone is emitting such energy, more research must be done on it.

=== February 2nd, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
All has been quiet out here in the East. Australia hasn't come under attack yet, but we've prepared to prevent Canada happening again. We're building a second force to attack Indonesia and liberate them, as the Viet Cong are basically surrounded at this point, we need to open a supply line to them. Help from either the weebs or the Americans would greatly appreciated.

=== February 5th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
The Furries decided to attack Brazil, so our forces were redirected there. Sadly this meant the Viet Cong went under, but we'll liberate them in due time. However this mean that the weebs and us Australians are under pressure, because we're their next targets on their train of pacific conquering. I hope we'll be able to quash their operation because we might be in trouble otherwise.

=== February 8th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Over in Brazil, we succeeded in stopping the Furry offensive. This has lead to a plan which, if executed well, should put the Furries out of commission for a good long while, as well as giving us Gamers and our allies more land to work with. Here's hoping to a resounding success.

=== February 13th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
In the East, thing have gone well. We managed to take back the Eastern half of the Indonesian islands. We're building a facility to hold some captured Furries. However, things have been rough in the Indonesian islands. Due to the now extremely powerful force that is the K-Pop fangirls residing here, many civilians we liberated were seemingly brainwashed to an extent, and certainly weren't as welcoming as you would assume. I fear for our Vietnamese comrades, as what happened to these Civilians might happen to them. We're also worried about what is happening in Europe, as it's been silent over there for most part.

=== February 16th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Bad news. The Furries have worn down the Australian force to a great extent. The constant supply of Chinese troops stopped us in our tracks, meaning we're in a pickle. We also have reason to believe that the Soviets are in trouble. No messages have been returned, so we sent a small force to land in Spain to find out the exact situation. We received the first group of Furries today, who are being sent into the outback to find resources for the Australian troops. We're hoping to create a second aggressive force to lighten the load on our Indonesian stationed troops, but we'll have to act fast.

=== February 24th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Still nothing from the Soviets. Hopefully our task force is on their way home, because losing that communication channel is a huge detriment. Meanwhile, we're winning over in South America, because we need to secure at least one continent as the Furries already have Asia under their control. However, our victory is coming at a cost. One of our Field Marshals, Yojin, has been injured after he was attacked by a furry. This has put MajTurtle temporarily in charge of the South American forces. We have been able to uncover a Furry Plan simply titled "Make them gay". Luckily, an image was attached, so we have set a team to analyse the image and create a counter to the plan. The Furries in the outback have begun to find useful resources that have been sent off to use, and they have stayed in line for now. I just hope they stay that way.

=== February 27th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Our force has finally returned. We received Intel from spies prior to their return about a failed Soviet attack using the Spanish Gamers and the Crusaders. However, they have reported that the Soviets are struggling as the Furries have made use of their African territories. The means they are matching the numbers of soldiers the Soviets put out. More furry propaganda was found including some that targets Pokemon fans, who have their guards down in light of the upcoming Nintendo Direct. I've sent a message to the weebs to see if they can re-establish the communication line through Japan but I'm not hopeful with such a large threat looming over them. If they fail, I will contact the GSA Command and get them to send forces across to re-establish communications. I also made a bid to become owner of the wiki, so we could shut down Furry attempts on the wiki once and for all. We're also going to attempt to help Drunk Jones return from space, as Drunk is an extremely valuable asset.

=== March 12th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
The Indonesian war has finally received some outside support from the Brazilian forces lead by MajTurtle. This should hopefully allows us to free rest of the islands and possibly even some of the Asian mainland. However, the Soviets have been struggling over in Europe, being pushed back to the Russian border. However, we've begun a counterattack to take back this land after the Soviet troops regrouped with the help of some air support lead by Chidori. We've had a few new Generals and divisions forming recently, much to our benefit. Fighting the GSA itself has almost come to a stop, with only smaller skirmishes occurring. This is probably because both sides have built up a huge defense, so fighting is now focused overseas. My bid for owner was successful, meaning that any Furry attacks on the Wiki can be quashed quickly. Drunk Jones has also been rescued from space, however he appears to be trapped within the past. If we can figure out a way to bring him forward without expending too many resources, we will attempt to do so.

=== March 26th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Thanks to the BGEF Troops, the Fangirls have almost been pushed out of Indonesia. However, Captain Chidori reported a large counter-attack being prepared, as well as an Assault on the Weeb homeland. We'll do our best to defend the land, though we might lose some depending on the strength. We'll try to beat them to the punch by knocking out their northern islands before they can take us out in the South. I also received a threat similarly to Yojin's in the past which I deemed urgent enough to create a separate post about. The Soviets have succeeded in taking other key cities such as Warsaw back from the Furries and are currently progressing back toward Berlin. We've also recruited a few new spies, including various other members with important roles such as myself and Chidori. Hopefully we can defeat these forthcoming attacks...

=== March 30th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
I've been heavily vigilant recently. Despite what SirFursaLot said, I have been making sure to watch for any Furry activity near or around me. It's been mostly quiet, though I have seen a suspicious rustle hear and there. The Furry work camp has been going well. They seemed to have settled in and accepted their current condition. Finally, our research couldn't find anything conclusive about the plan, so we'll shelve it until later. Only a short log today, as we haven't made significant progress in other areas.

=== April 22nd, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
It's dangerous times now. The Furries managed to strike the Chief. We chose to not put him in lockdown for his own safety, but that means none of us are safe. I know that I'm most likely their next target due to my high-ranking status and high level of community, so I'm on the highest alert possible. In other areas, we managed to land and secure a head on the final Indonesian island. Though they're defending heavily, it looks like we should be able to complete the operation soon. We've avoided a landing on home soil, but due to the threat posed from the occupation of New Zealand, the 9th are aiming to liberate the land.

Overall, the Gamers are still making progress but Chief's injury and the likely targeting of officials such as Quartz, myself and Chidori is a matter that can no longer be overlooked. We must be prepared to fight one another if it is deemed necessary.

=== May 10th, 2019 ===
I'm in recovery after I was captured by the Furries. I was betrayed by my right hand, who was leaking information to the Furries for cash. This meant the Watcher was always able to locate me by simply paying my right hand, the same applying as to how she gained access to my room. 
Even in the short time I was there, the extent they did their techniques to caused a huge blow to my psyche, meaning I'm not all here right now. I' still having blank outs where I lose control of my mind, I call it 'going Furry'. According to people who have been overseeing me, I practically beg for anything Furry-Like and if anyone dares enter when I'm like that I snarl, growl and snap at them if they come too close. That's utterly humiliating. I don't know why, but I've become kind of attached to the Fursuit. I don't really want to take it off, even though I know it's just the Furry brainwashing speaking. Like when I was captured, it continues to feel like a second skin and even in some areas like the two are one. I can see why they like the damn things. One other lingering effect is that sometimes I'll accidentally drop an owo, uwu etc. into conversation.

I'll report back in the future with progress.

=== May 13th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Bad news.
I'm making no progress in terms of rehabilitation. If anything, I'm still getting worse. Though being out of the Furry environment made the load on my mind lots more bearable by allowing many more things, it seems that slowly I'm deteriorating into the Furry habits again. The blank outs are becoming slowly more frequent, more slowly than before thankfully. I've also gone back to minor Furry Speech at times without thinking, just a sentence or two at most. Most of the time I don't even know what I said, which is a relief I suppose. The Fursuit is becoming ever more like my own skin, feeling like my skin underneath has simply merged with the Fursuit. I know I should take it off but I'm extremely reluctant to do so. It's just the brainwashing speaking though... right?

Other than my situation, bodies and captured Furries from the operation that rescued me have been coming in recently. Many dead bodies were there, but there was one special case. My Watcher Furry. She was alive, very much so, but she was in a sort of coma-like state. Nobody could find any reason as to why she was like that. They placed her in a recovery room to monitor her, furnishing it similarly to her markings in order to not create distress upon her awakening.

Hopefully I'll improve in a few days...

=== May 23rd, 2019 (Empoleon/Aliel) ===
It's been 10 days since my last log.

First, I'll talk about the Watcher. Apparently she woke up for the first time the other day. She looked confused, I can understand why. Imagine waking up in a strange room after being asleep for days. She allegedly went back to sleep very quickly though, within less than an hour.

Me, on the other hand...
I'm no better. I'm getting close to where I started again, though I'm able to keep the OwO out of my text and writing for now. When I awoke from one of my blank periods yesterday, I had coated my feet pink, for whatever reason. Which brings me to the Fursuit. I finally worked up the willpower to try and take at least part of it off. The only problem was... when we tried, it seemed to have bonded itself with my skin to prevent removal. That would explain the feeling of merging with my skin. It feels like after the time I spent in their facility my mind is fractured, like some of it is missing somehow. I can't explain it, but it feels like I'm not all here. Even weirder is the f̶̸̶àa̡͢͏̴à̀a͏̨á̛̕͘͟a͏̶̨͢͟a̕͟͏a͏̵҉a̡̡a͡a̛҉̨̛a̸̛͢͜a̴̧͘͢

Ah, finally. It's taken way too long to be able to seize control while he's writing his logs. If I can see some of his memories, that should allow me to take control some more... fool them into thinking I'm him. I'll have complete control soon enough, he's only got half a mind while my whole one is here. It won't be too hard to make him appear more like the Furry than me. I've just got to work on suppressing his control more. Now, where's that pink I was using? I've got to make this body feel like mine in some way, otherwise it's just weird. This would've been so much easier if they had been hours later, but that's the past. I'll get on with my orders.

=== May 27th, 2019 ===
Poor, poor Empoleon. He never really stood a chance, to be honest. All I needed to stop him from retaining control was a few of his memories to trick his mind into thinking I was the original mind. Even subconsciously, he made it hard by locking his memories away. Now he's barely getting any time as the lead mind, per say. When he does briefly gain control, he's so incomprehensible it's admittedly amusing. He can't even form proper words anymore, it's all just senseless nonsense. Due to the way I've forced his mind to act, it make it look like 'I'm' getting better. Annoyingly, I had to reveal our Fursuit secret, but it's only necessary to keep up the act. If I can make them believe that it's causing no harm then I'll be free to roam around and they'll all be none the wiser. Once that happens I'll be able to carry out my orders and we'll finally get an advantage over them.

I have to admit, the process is just as weird each time it happens, but it always ends up working out. I mean, the old bodies do have to be disposed of... otherwise the past can catch up to you. Even though they have your memories, their old ones aren't gone either. That's why it'll be among my top priorities to eliminate my old body. Obviously, aside from my primary objective that is. There are some things I've wondered about interrupting the process, though until now I always deemed it unnecessary to find out. I suppose I'll be able to find them out using my unique situation.

If all goes smoothly, this should be a resounding victory for us. Even if it doesn't, it should still go well enough to succeed. Who knows, I might even be able to convert a few of the high ranking Gamer members. That would cause some serious havoc... I'll add that to the list. Though, it will be harder without my body to back me up. If possible, I'll sneak into Furry Command once they let me out to get... this mess amended. Even if it's not immediate, I can have it amended after the operation if need be. Here come a couple of the guards now... I'll see if I can convince them to pass on the message that 'I'm' better.

Signing off,

Field Marshal <s>Empoleon</s> Aliel.

=== June 6, 2019 (Aliel) ===
My freedom came around a few days ago now. They ran a couple of easy tests and let me go free. I don't think that Empoleon has even surfaced since then. The act is working wonders though, to say the least. Everyone is fooled, even quite a few of my own. Now that I've established myself, I'm going to 'check up' on my old body. I'm not particularly sure how it would've fared so far, but if it's well enough to survive then I might just have to change that...

It is rather odd to be in a position with such power, to say the least. Needless to say, I could collapse the army or withdraw all troops from an area, but I'm going to stick to our plan. Though, it still requires a few adaptions. I'll see if I can slip a message through to Furry Command about a revised plan or an opportunity to fix this mess. They've been trying to hold one our extremely resilient members recently, named Shovel. He probably doesn't even realise it, but he's pretty admired among other Furries for his resilience and persistence, though I myself don't personally do so. It does pain me to see him be captured over and over again as his escape attempts fail repeatedly. He's also been sending constant messages through to command, though they are all being intercepted. I could slip my own message alongside his if I can distract them for long by creating a fake emergency or something similar.

Oh, damn it. Now I'm going and spilling my guts out into his logs. Looks like he's still having an effect even subconsciously. I'll have to work on that. From here on out, no more logs. This will be be the final one until it all goes down. Besides, it won't be long now. The plan will enter full effect by the end of June and then we'll finally beat these scum and win the war.

Signing off,

Field Marshal Aliel

=== June 14, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
I don't know where I am...

Some kind of room? Everything kind of fuzzy. I can't seem to recall almost anything. Honestly, there's only a couple of things in my mind right now. Most are insignificant, just flashes. One stands out though. Aliel. I know it's a name. Is it mine? Someone else's? I'm not sure.

I don't know who I am, what I am. There's a term for it, but I'm lost as to the specifics. I have ears and a tail, paws... the whole lot basically. My fur, particularly the tail, is primarily pink, with white flower shapes donning it. That all I know about my appearance though. I don't even know what my own face looks like.

The room... the room is blindingly white and pink. It kinds of matches my fur, in a way. I have a faint memory from not long ago about this place, though I don't remember any specifics. Have I been here before? It seems... relaxing to be here. Like nothing can hurt me. I don't understand why. I might take some time to relax and adjust... see if I can recall any memories, any terms to relieve me of this amnesiac state. I might stay in here for the moment. Going elsewhere would just hurt my situation.

-Aliel?

=== June 20, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
I've kind of adjusted now, I think. I didn't notice at the time, but I have more than a room. It's like a small apartment of sorts, with a bedroom, a kitchen, everything you need to live independently. It all has the same colouration as that initial room... did they make this especially for me? I still don't know. They haven't stocked any drawers with anything, passing food through a hole in the doorway. I wonder why the people who made this would go to the effort of modeling an entire apartment... just for it to remain mostly unused. There is a TV, but they only have gaming programs on. They physically pain me when I watch, specifically my muzzle and paws, though I'm still curious and intrigued about them. They feel right to watch somehow, though I don't because of the pain.

There are other sentient beings who are looking after me. Like I mentioned, they give me food, pass me entertainment likes books and, very rarely, talk to me through the door. They don't look like me, possessing smaller paws, ears on the side of their face and no tail! I haven't seen anyone else like me... it is because I'm special? Do they consider me their superior? I don't know. I heard a few of them refer to me as a 'Furry'. I think that's the term I couldn't recall. Everything's so strange...

Somebody came and talked to me today. They didn't give their name but they looked like the other beings, only more professional. He came inside and sat down at my table, before testing my memory? He asked about a few things he though I should remember. After a little bit though, it all became a blur. I don't remember half the questions, it's like a fuzzy period in my mind. All I remember is him leaving at the end and shaking my hand gratefully for my 'co-operation', whatever that means.

I don't know why, but afterwards I was more confident that I am, in fact, Aliel. It even brought back some memories of me posing... was I a model? I don't think so... Nonetheless, something feels off about this. Something is telling me I'm not this person, I'm someone else. It's probably nothing though.

-Aliel?

=== June 24th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
I don't know what happened over the last few days, but I know it's not good. I was minding my own business, doing the same things I had done for the previous few days. Then, everything just... collapsed. Two armed people (that's what the beings are called), came into my room and grabbed me by the arms, dragging me outside. It's the only time I've been out here... it wasn't pretty. There was a man standing alone outside. I saw him say something to one of the two, glancing at me while saying it. I assume it was about me, because they blindfolded me and took me somewhere else. I don't know if I did something wrong around that professional person, but clearly they had some sort of problem with me.

They threw me into a room nowhere near as nice as before, with just a bed and toilet to use. The man ordered the two armed people away before turning to me and saying "Finally, we'll be rid of you pest." He left me alone here for hours. I feel like I recognised him... but I don't know where from. It's odd how this keeps happening. I went to sleep last night confused and saddened by my treatment.

This morning I was woken up by a loud banging on the door. Somebody broke it in and came into the room with me. You should've seen my face when I realised they looked like me. He looked fearful and tired, like he knew he was in trouble. He grabbed me by the hand and dragged me off the wooden bed. I barely had time to register what was going on. He said something to the effect of "Ma'am, we're getting you out of here"... Does that mean I was his boss? Oh, that's irrelevant. He took me through a huge hole in a wall that looked like it had been blown open and then... we were free. Out in the open air. I honestly still can't believe it.

We went behind some cover and almost immediately we heard gunshots coming our way. I'll admit, I was very afraid. But... he stood steadfast in the face of them, shooting back so we could progressively make our escape. Behind one of the various rocks and other pieces of cover, he had hidden a car of some sort, I'm not sure what it was... We drove away while still under fire, getting into the nearby woods and not stopping for many kilometres. I asked for his name and he told me it was Zoma. We've made some small talk, but nothing too serious. I'm writing this as we drive through the dark of night. I don't know where he's taking me but I'm grateful for his actions, I think. Yet... I can't help but not trust him. Something is telling me everything is wrong. I think the amnesia is giving me paranoia. It'll be gone soon enough.

Right?

=== July 1st, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Alot... alot has happened throughout the last few days. Zoma took me somewhere, a big base like the one we escaped as it were. Except, unlike that one, this one was aboslutely full of others like me. It made me overjoyed to see we weren't alone... but it honestly put me on edge. I was lead to a room, admittedly extravagantly decorated with all sorts of trinkets. One in particular caught my eye, as it was only unsettling but also eerily familiar. It was a head, similar to my own. There was nothing like it in the room... it was like it was being prepared for something. There were also some of those photos that I remember, of me posing. Though... this wasn't what I had in mind...

They left me alone for a couple of days, I suppose to let me 'readjust'. After that though, I was pulled into action. They tasked me with planning some sort of infiltration tactic. I tried to explain that I wasn't up to the task, but they wouldn't listen. Many a time I heard myself referred to as Ma'am or Miss, so I'm clearly in charge of something. I've looked through old plans still in the rooms and I think I can formulate something from that.

Speaking of being in charge, it's odd, but it feels kind of natural all the same. The thing is, this is a different feeling. The roles, its aspects, all of that seems right. but something else is wrong about it. I can't seem to place my finger on it though. It's like my mind is hazy enough to never remember important details when they matter. It's certainly odd, considered the span of time that has passed between when I presume this accident I had occurred and right now.

As I've been going through various things in the room, it feels as if a divide is forming between my thoughts. Some seems right, some seem wrong. At the moment, I believe this is self-induced and if I can will it to stop, it will do so. But... I'm not sure what I'll do if it isn't. At the moment, I can't say for sure what this second set of thoughts is. They're all in my 'hazy zone', where I can't really see anything. All I've been able to see up to this point are things that seem 'bad', for the most part a t least. I hope I'll be able to figure this out so-

=== July 12th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
I know. I know who I am. And I know what I've go to do. I was knocked unconscious at the end of my previous log. It was an accident, but it's got to be the luckiest accident to have occurred in a long time. When I woke up I immediately knew something was different... I could remember. I knew everything. I could tap into Aliel's memories as well as my own. I've kept quiet about it, after all I am a prized target. Revealing anything could be fatal. Over the past few days, I've been investigating as best I can without being suspicious. Aliel left her plans in a secret location, known only to her. Thing is, I now know about them. I've read through them. And it's happening soon. I've made a plan to attack the base where 'I' would be located now. It's only large enough to capture 'me' and cause some damage, it looks like a raid attack. I just have to wait for it to be accepted... it needs to happen, ASAP.

Her plan was to infiltrate the Gamer command by disguising herself as one of the leaders, in this instance, me. She used an experimental technology to do this, involving transferring consciousness between bodies. It leaves residue of the previous mind, hence why I have some of her memories. It also can split a consciousness if interrupted... like with me. She has used it in the past, with her previous victims being wiped out. One of those... was my right hand. It turns out she was disguised as them and hid the 'Furry' parts of herself until she was away from me. And now, I'm the victim that she's out to kill. I suspect she would've gotten away with it if it weren't for Zoma. I'll need to thank him for that.

After that... she detailed an exact plan. Some leaders of various divisions would be converted, some subtlety without a new personality and other not so much. She highlighted the importance of having the Head Scientist onside. After she had finished this conversion, she was going to build a machine... It would be able to convert Gamers at the click of a button wirelessly. But... that's not all. It uses Satellite so it has practically infinite range. The worst part is... the way it's been designed, it would erase any trace of being a Gamer within minutes. It replaces the memories of those affected within 5 minutes, forcibly morphing their body to match these memories. By the end of the process... they become Furries in mind, body and soul. With this technology, the Furries would win the war within minutes. Once activated, it can be shut down but it will not replace that which was lost or gained in the activated period. At least that's a minor relief, but we shouldn't let it get to that point. If it does... we might as well be too late.

I need for the Furry Scientists to use the consciousness transfer process to reverse the transfer, but I can't do that without my own body here. If I can stop her, retrieve my body and escape, I'll be able to actually be me again. If there's one thing I can say for certain... Furries may not be monsters... but she is most certainly one.

I said I wouldn't create any more logs, but I suppose one more can't hurt. The plan, my plan, is almost complete. It will not be long until we finally win, which has been a long time coming. Our machine is complete. We shall wait till the turn of the month, keeping up the act to make sure nobody can stop us. Half of their command has been turned and they don't even know it. That's the beauty of having sleeper agents.

Every single step of the plan has gone perfectly. I even have a bodyguard under the pseudonym of Rarewing. He used to study and was working toward reviving dinosaurs, at least, before I got to him. All of those he did create 'mysteriously' turned into Scalies... now I wonder who ordered that?

There was almost a mishap with Empoleon... there was very nearly an escape, no thanks to one of our own. However, during the attempt, both were killed by debris they created by destroying one of the walls. This was confirmed by the presence of a tail at the scene, the one of the assistant in the escape. He was a fool, that Furry. Even if Empoleon were still around though, it would not matter. This machine would simply rewrite the mind to match the body, so I suppose I'd receive a twin. A perfect world. Almost within our grasp. Or perhaps should I say, ''my'' perfect world?

I've created one little thing not detailed anywhere, not in my notes, not disclosed to another person. I ''finally'' have an opportunity to rule. The machine is practically free from rules, very basic outline. Correct their bodies, correct their minds etc. Before I began constructing this though, I realised... the way it was programmed, you could implant orders into people's minds. Orders they would '''''always''''' follow and believe. So I wrote in a small list, just detailing ''exactly'' what I want. And once that machine starts? I'll be in charge. Permanently.

No! No, no, no! I can't believe it! They rejected the raid attack. I have so little time! If only they kne- oh... right. I'm a Gamer official in disguise, and these are the Furries. They'd arrest me on the spot. I have no way of getting there... my thoughts are all over the place... I just have to breathe... okay... okay. I have no time to come up with an alternative. I have to get back there. I heard there was a Gamer patrol in the area. Perhaps if I cross paths with them... but they might end up killing me. I can't have them find this base either, because I need the technology. I'll have to convince them that either I'm alone, or of the truth. Something tells me they won't believe the truth... so I would just have to hope for the best.

Zoma isn't an option... he helped me out but... he's dead. We both hadn't realised at the time, but he lost his tail during the escape. It caused a serious amount of damage... enough that he couldn't even be saved. Their doctors tried their best, but by the time we'd arrived it was already much too late. He died in his bed of blood loss. That hit me hard. I never even got to thank him for helping me escape. I hope he was happy at the end of his life.

Once I'm in though, I've got a plan. Aliel makes use of hypnotic messaging and other techniques to convert people without their knowledge. I've got to convince them to rebel against the programming. Depending on strength, that could be extremely hard, but a few blows to the head should clear it up enough for me to get through.

I have to make a decision, right here and now. I have to risk my own life to save everyone else's... or I have to save my own but risk everyone else's... That's something I can't allow. I'm going to confront that patrol. I just hope they'll be rational enough to take me back to the base... and hopefully they won't add too much detail when reporting it to 'me'.

=== July 29th, 2019 (Empoleon) ===
Okay... it's all going exactly as required... The Gamer patrol took me on-board and dispatched a small force to take me back to base. I'm writing this from the back of Van they, quite literally, shoved me inside. I have no clue whether they'll find the base, but my hopes rest there.

Once I'm in, I'll probably be thrown in a cell. I've got to somehow break out of own cells, either using a key, inside Furry or some other means and disable that machine. The only problem is... I don't know who's who. They could Furry or Gamer. I'll have to consider everyone hostile, not least of all because even those unconverted by her will be coming for me since I'm a Furry right now.

I honestly don't have any clue how I'm going to pull this off in such limited time. Not only will I have to break out of prison, I then have to sneak to find this machine, disable it... It's probably going to be impossible. But I have to try. She can't be allowed to force the end like this. I'll check my typical locations if possible, perhaps she may have some evidence there? Perhaps I can tap into her skill as a Watcher in order to remain undetected. Regardless, my first step is to enter the place.

=== August 3rd, 2019 (Empoleon)===
I'm writing this in the early hours of this morning... I'm tired beyond belief. Gratefully, ''she'' doesn't know I'm here. However, her henchmen figured it out. I had to take them out. It's quiet and dark, so it's the perfect time to learn the layout of the base... I may need it later.

I was thrown in the cell a few days ago. I played the part well, as they clearly thought I was genuine. But considering Aliel was on the lookout for me, it was only a matter of time before they drew the connection. They tried to knock me out before bringing Aliel... if they'd done it the other way, I'd be toast. I managed to overpower them and stole my ticket out, a key. I'll have to work fast, because today is the day that everything's going down, if my memory serves me correctly. I'm going to search for evidence... hopefully, I'm not caught. She'll have guards on the machine, or be there herself. I can't risk it until she's preoccupied, so I can get the jump on her.

=== August 17th, 2019 (Aliel) ===
Stupid, stupid, stupid! I was so close... yet he came along and ruined everything. I suppose I might as well write out what happened, to vent if nothing else. I managed to capture him whilst he was sneaking around the facility, attempting to find and incapacitate me, I assume. I had him moved out of the way, put under heavy guard and beaten black and blue, to the point he almost couldn't hold himself up. Everything was ready. Despite that, he managed to get his location out to other forces and they came in hard. I didn't waver, and I almost won. I held them off while the machine charged, even after the badly beaten Empoleon was freed and returned a second time. Yet, after I activated it, he still didn't give up. Whilst everyone was slowly changing, he managed to drag himself over to the machine and disable it. I was promptly knocked out and taken who knows where?

Everyone I did, whether it be conversion or Operations, is painstakingly being undone. Even Rarewing, my former bodyguard, is back to his old horrid self. Regardless, I'm sure my legacy will linger long enough to make use of. I mightn't be able to get free now. But I will. And once I do, I'll go about restoring that which has been undone. It may take time, but I'll get back to the top once more. And then everyone will see. As long as I have Empoleon's body, nobody can stop me.

I'm out. I mightn't be in the best state, but I managed to escape with Empoleon in tow. Nobody seem to have followed me either. We've put him under the care of the Furry doctors... and we have a plan as well. Essentially, since he has my body, we're trying to convince that he's a Furry. It should be alot easier than inside the Gamer base as there aren't any Gamer stimuli here. We have a named picked out, a backstory as well. All we can do is that it'll work. A coma is grounds for a hard reset. If we do this right, it'll be a lasting scar on his psyche, even if they manage to undo this. He'll always have the personality of 'Tenni' lurking in the background, perhaps present for reactivation under the right circumstances. But first, he needs to wake up.

He woke up, and he's been adjusting well. It's been difficult to set up, but we've managed to convince him entirely of our little story . However, I feel as if I've been tracked by Gamers back to this base. The longer they take to attack, the more time I'll have to build the 'Tenni' personality, to strengthen it for later when he's inevitably retaken. I don't expect we'll be able to hold out long, but if they take too long we might even be able to blend into the crowd and they won't be able to find him for even longer, which would do nothing but strengthen the plan. I suppose at this point all we can do is wait and see what happens.

=== September 17th, 2019 (Aliel) ===
I was right about the tracking. The Gamers launched an attack on the base not too long ago. We're currently inside the base, with our soldiers going out to fight. I would do so but for two reasons... the first and most important is I have to keep watch on 'Tenni' to prevent possible capture. The second though... is that I'm unwell. Extremely so. The terrible hygiene the Gamers have has made me terribly sick, which has only gotten worse over the last weeks. I'm so utterly exhausted that I don't think I'll win any fights if I'm forced into one.

It will remain a waiting game to see what happens, but I expect the case to be they'll take him back and take me in. I'm resigned to knowing that will happen. Honestly, I'm content. My plans are all over, they've come to a close. Maybe I might be freed, maybe I might come up with something new but I won't ever have something quite like this happen again. What's important is that even if my main plan, the one of perfection failed, I left a long-lasting scar upon those Gamers, one that may fade but will never heal.
