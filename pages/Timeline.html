|Reddit user /u/HanAssholeSolo constructs a gif of now President Trump battling his nemesis, CNN. After territories like r/The_Donald and /pol/ spread word of this new super-weapon, it would become the meme seen round the world.
|-
|July 2, 2017
|President Donald Trump mysteriously catches word of this new super-weapon, and takes to twitter to launch /u/HanAssholeSolo's gif. It is a confirmed hit on CNN. The casualties on CNN's side are low, but they aren't about to go down with a fight. Quickly, CNN's top investigative agent, Andrew Kaczynski begins conducting espionage on Trump's warhead. He realized that to prevent another attack, he must put a stop to the production of any more weapons of mass destruction.


Before long, CNN's agents had begun a full on manhunt to find HanAssholeSolo.
|-
|July 4, 2017
|Shortly after the Presidents tweet, HanAssholeSolo gives himself away on reddit: "Holy shit!! I wake up and have my morning coffee and who retweets my shitpost but the MAGA EMPEROR himself!!! I am honored!!". CNN was able to track him down from there using his post history to link him to his personal Facebook. From here on out, HanAssholeSolo was a hostage. CNN gave him an ultimatum: Delete everything, or be doxxed. In exchange for his privacy, HanAssholeSolo purged his reddit history and issued an apology to CNN. CNN then issued this statement: "CNN is not publishing "HanA**holeSolo's" name because he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.
CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change."


Now CNN had squashed the one that stung them, but in doing so, they shook the hornet's nest. 4chan wasn't about to let HanAssholeSolo be silenced in vain. They coordinated Operation: Autism Storm, aka [https://meme.fandom.com/wiki/Meme_War_II Meme War II]. Their plan? To create so many CNN memes, that tracking down a single target would be futile.
|-
|July 5, 2017
|This Operation: Autism Storm attack was a multi-stage battle strategy. First, the alliance, an agreement between former frenemies, Reddit and 4chan, against the common foe of CNN. The second part was the Meme War. The third part was to target the money that funds CNN, by contacting CNN's advertisers.


The early strikes launched at CNN were through twitter. The first, making the hashtag #CNNblackmail trending for many to see, and the second: getting prominent figures to tell everyone that CNN's hostage was a 15-year-old boy. Both of these attacks were massive successes, #CNNBlackmail quickly becomes a trending hashtag, and Donald Trump's own son tweets out that the person threatened by CNN was only a 15-year-old. The only way CNN can counter that accusation is by releasing their information on him, which would then result in possible legal problems and them being further under attack on all sides.


In a short manner of time, every message board, every feed, every platform was overwhelmed by CNN memes.


Deciding that real blood had to be drawn, the Kekistani army then started to attack one of the only things CNN cares about: it's ratings. The CNN iOS Apple App swiftly plummeted to a 1.1 star rating. A very decisive victory.


Then, wanting to help keep morale and meme production at an all time high, Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson created the first Meme Contest: 20 THOUSAND DOLLARS to whoever makes the meme that they like the most about CNN. In the past, internet polls and contests were destroyed by 4Chan shitposting, but now an actual contest was born specifically for 4chan to shitpost.
|-
|July 6, 2017
|After the initial burst of memes, some damage reports started coming in. There were a number of reputable media sources covering the meme war. This only helps show the Kekistani armies and the forces of Reddit that their war is one they believe they can win, further increasing their morale. But while some were celebrating, others were scheming. Already there were rumors suggesting CNN got the wrong guy. Could it be possible that this whole thing was started from a mistake? Or quite possibly, that the original poster lied for karma and got swept up in a huge mess? It was hard to know...
|-
|July 12, 2017
|A Full 6 days later and not a bullet from the CNN headquarters. They had their small time mercenaries fighting in the trenches, but no large-scale officially sanctioned show of force from the CNN side of the trenches. Some reports are stating that the impossible has happened- A company actually learned to stop feeding the troll. And while their original article still stands, it looks as if they have surrendered to the power of memes. This strategy may work as things finally begin to cool down. But, while the war still wages in the minds and hearts of men, one must ask, "what will be the aftermath of Meme War 2"?

Units marched through the city of Seattle, along with San Francisco as they had already been taken by gamers in the second furry war. In the meantime, the Oregon Resistance free multiple parts of Oregon and has all corners of the state under control. All the while, Dissident Furries have faced massive casualties from airstrikes and special forces raids, it is rumored that many have fled to fight for the Brony military junta in China.

|ISAF leader "Chio" called for leaders of the Furry-Loyalists and Gamers to discuss plans to prevent the rise of an extremely powerful and militaristic Brony-controlled China, which has grown in terms of military power due to assistance from the Dissidents. He said though, that plans should be made once the Kingdom gives up fighting, in order to not exhaust soldiers by dragging them into another theater of war.

In Europe, the Brony military, unable to contain the mass spread of mutinies throughout, called for an immediate ceasefire with the Gamer-aligned forces in the region. Soon a televised address by the European-Brony military leaders was made almost immediately upon such news. They wanted to discuss the terms of the ceasefire in Paris on the 17th and assured that no harm will be done to the leaders. Discussions within the USGR, Fifth Reich, Void Hand Empire, the TailBiters, and the Swarm began regarding the Paris meeting.

|Upon securing Seattle and San Francisco (with the help of gamers in the respective cities), ISAF has begun supplying the allied resistance movements found all over the West Coast with weapons. The fighting in Portland ends with the ISAF freeing the city, thanks to the Oregon Resistance assisting the soldiers with intelligence and fighting alongside them. The city is then handed over to the resistance under the orders of "Chio".

In Anchorage, a hunt for the remaining heads of state of the Kingdom officially begins as special forces raids occur across the West Coast in great fashion. With their defensives completely collapsed, the Brony soldiers in large quantities surrender, while the remaining loyal soldiers regroup in the former state of Nevada where they plan to muster up great resistance.

The Furry-Loyalists secure most of the New York state as few thousand Bronies prepare to fight in the Big Apple. Gamers take control of over half of Virginia, while paratrooper assaults begin Maryland to prevent the enemy from digging in deep in the state.

Dissident Furries lose virtually all territory in Canada and in the Northern half of the United States due to heavy losses in both manpower and equipment, the Loyalist military claim victory despite Gamers saying that the fight is not over.

|In an effort to cripple the junta's industrial complex, a series of violent cyberattacks occur. The nation's technological might is lost in a span of hours. Gamers begin advancing with the Loyalist Furries Northward to take down the enemy forces once and for all. Soviet air strikes succeed in distracting a large chunk of the hostile air force. The enemy military then does a surprising move by invading the Kpop Fangirl Republic of Korea.

A covert raid organized by Furry-Loyalists and Gamers (with the intelligence help of ISAF) in order to secure a vitally important military complex located deep in Northern California. They found (supposedly) all that remained of the ZAK-19 conversion gas, along with warheads containing it. Files indicating of a terrifying rumor that such weapons were transported to China by Dissidents were found.

The First Alt-Furry war ends, but continues as a skirmish.

The ISAF launched a full-scale invasion in South Korea in order to liberate the peninsula from the Bronies and the Kpop Fangirl army, now serving as collaborators to the junta. Other sources point to another reason behind the invasion of the south, more so in the lines of containing communism and the reach of the AAC. This has sparked tensions between ISAF and the Fifth Reich, and even (rumored) open hostilities against the Anti-Anime Clan. This has caused quite a shock for the rest of the Allied Forces.

Many are fearing that they may have defected towards the enemy forces or something else entirely.

The Allied Forces in China have now reached the central districts despite intense resistance. The junta's military has begun facing devastating losses.

A plan was organized that would turn the Gamer-aligned Korea into a democratic nation where provinces would hold autonomy but regulated by the national government. The plan also called for political parties of different ideologies to exist. Rights would also be granted to the Kpop fangirls, traditionalists, and the communists. Finally, a peacekeeping force (under the supervision of the USGR) would be created to maintain stability in Korea. With all parties unanimously agreeing to the plan, the Panmunjon Summit was a massive success.

|[[The 3rd Furry War]] begins.
|-
|A Gamer resupply convoy is ambushed by a Furry Air Raid west of North Bay, Quebec. A total of 63 survivors were confirmed. A Furry platoon moved onto the scene, slaughtering half the survivors and taking the others as prisoners. This attack shocks Gamers across the globe, as it is the first major attack by the Furries since October 12th, 2019. Many fear another war, and hundreds of Gamer, Weeb, New Kingdom, and 5th Reich units across the world are put on high alert. Satellite pictures of a Furry Air Base in Canada are confirmed.

''[[The Cult of Mr.Miller]] ''airdrops double the number of supplies, troops, and sandwiches lost to the U.S.G.R. in retaliation to the raid.
|-
|In the aftermath of the Furry air raid, numerous Furry task forces from around the world strike at Gamer bases worldwide. Thousands of Gamers are massacred before a proper defense can be built. The worst case of these is when Furry Death Squads attack the Command Center of the New Kingdom in a kamikaze raid. It has been confirmed that what is left of the Brony Military has joined the Furry army. Hundreds of terrorist acts are carried out everywhere before being repelled. It is a surefire signal that another war is upon us.
|-
|In Retaliation against the Furry Attacks, [[The 5th Reich]] launches V2 Rockets at three Furry Military Bases in Canada, destroying them. It is the first action the Gamers take against the Furries in the 3rd Furry War

|The Furries launch 250 B-1 Bombers over the Northeastern U.S. AA fire from the Gamers destroys small bits of the Formation. The Gamers launch MIG E-152 Interceptors given to them by the Soviets. They destroy more than half of the Bomber Formation, forcing the rest to retreat. The bombers did minor damage to the Gamer.
''[[The Cult of Mr.Miller]] ''sends a telegram to all Gamer-Aligned factions requesting a list of their needs, seeking to end this war quickly.
|-
|In retaliation to Gamer attacks, Furries commence Air Raids dropping bombs filled with a gas-based form of UwUiLizer. It is the first use of the product in a long time, and hundreds of animal units of the armies are infected. Such uses of dogs, for example, K-9 units, is postponed for some time. A covert raid against ''[[The Cult of Mr.Miller]]'' results in the death of many of their operatives and the slowing of supplies, many of which are captured or blown up.

Fortunately, this raid was on a Cult owned bunker, not the Cult, as the location of the Cult's base of operation is still completely unknown even to the Gamers. Any operatives who died were unimportant and those who were taken captive were blank slates, raising questions and suspicions about the Cult. [[User:高槻命果|Cult Assistant Meika]] voices the displease of ''Mr.Miller'' but refuses to declare war, instead requesting the assistance of [[The 5th Reich]].

|Furries in the Northwestern Territories province of Canada report what looks like a fleet of Transport Ships escorted by Destroyers, Light Cruisers, And two Aircraft Carriers heading North, towards the Arctic Circle. The Furries send two Cruisers to investigate. The Furries use Long Range binoculars and see that fleet of ships are bearing the flag of The 5th Reich Kriegsmarine. Before the Furry Cruisers can get barely any closer to the fleet of ships, they are torpedoed and sunk by 5th Reich U-Boats.

The Furries, instead of attacking the recovering Gamers, focus their attacks on the United States and other areas taken over by the Loyalists, trying to take back the land they once had. They also set their sights on Hawaii, which is being operated by Gamers. An Arial fly-over confirms the Furries have based on both the Arctic and the Antarctic and that they are building some sort of mass-destruction weapon.

The 5th Reich mounts an invasion of the Furry base in the Arctic. Furry reinforcements in the area go to defend the Furry base and were successful. 5th Reich U-Boats retaliate by destroying the Furry cruisers docked on the coast, leaving the furries with no way to escape. Many cases of frost-related deaths were reported within the 5th Reich's ranks, as they didn't have the necessary protection yet from the cold.

The 5th Reich wins the battle of the Arctic in just under two hours. The furry weapon and the facility it is in is destroyed. The remaining Furry Arctic Defense surrenders to the 5th Reich. Shortly after the battle, the 5th Reich Transport ships begin unloading construction supplies and begin building Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe, And Kriegsmarine Bases in the Arctic for a planned Invasion.

''[[The Cult of Mr.Miller]] ''sends multiple shipments of troops, supplies, and sandwiches to [[Loyalists|The Loyalists]] of the US through unknown means in order to retaliate to the recent furry attacks.

|The Soviet Union launches a Bombing Raid on the Furry base in the Antarctic. On their approach to the base, The Soviet Tu-95 Bombers are permitted not to go above 50 feet in the air to avoid enemy radar and keep the element of surprise. They charge at the enemy base at full speed while dodging AA fire and arrive at the base and drop a few bombs on the facility, only now are bombers allowed to gain altitude. They begin to climb and circle back around to make another pass, they continue this until they have dropped all of the bombs in their bomb bays and the enemy base is destroyed. The Soviet bombers make it back to base unharmed.

Meanwhile on the other side of the world in the Arctic Circle, a lone Furry ship is scanning the Arctic for 5th Reich Bases. The 5th Reich launches a Dornier Do-217 Torpedo Bomber and sinks it.

In Texas, the NGR, Patriots, and clan now control a quarter of the state. Tactics are followed: NGR and the Clan controls police stations and major cities by force while the Patriots search homes that belong to the weebs, massacring them. Texas is one of the most unstable states and is also recorded being the most active in Anti-Anime presence; therefore making the revolutions more successful than expected.

While DGR scientists attempted to find a cure for the new deadly virus, the captured Alt-Furries revealed that they were behind all of the terrorists that appeared during the peace age.

|The Alt-Furries and Tik-Tokkers spread worldwide, arriving in Africa, Europe, Asia and South America in huge numbers. Upon the arrival of the Alt-Furs and Alt-Tokkers in Asia, the [[Empire of Japan|Kyotian Empire]], [[the Chan Dynasty|Chan Dynasty]], and [[The United Provinces of Korea|UPK]] declare war. Relatively small amounts of their armies are sent in a joint force to deal with the invaders, who are overpowered by the forces of Asia but do not back down.

Chaos remains in the US due to terrified citizens. The Alt Furries in New York City receive Reinforcement from other Alt-Furry Occupied cities and drive the Allied Forces out of the city. [[New Spain]] begins to bring in tens of millions of units from off-world to further strengthen the presence and defence of their forces in the war. 

The Kingdom of Scandinavia begins threatening VH executions to Alt furs and Alt Tokkers who refuse to leave the kingdom peacefully. This results in a mass immigration of the enemy out of the KOS 

As the USF learns of the recapture of NYC, forces in the city have been doubled and close to tripled as they work to force the Alts back out the city. New Spain comes to the aid of the USF for the second recapture of New York, also bringing triple they had compared to the first time. 

With the USF, New Spain, Alameda country, 5th Reich, and UNSC bringing in three times the number of units compared to the first time, the alliance manages to push into New York City a second time and completely force the Alt Furries out of all boroughs, unlike the first time. 

The YGC ambushes several fleeing Alt furry ships and begins raiding towns that surround NYC. The King of Scandinavia himself has been seen on the frontlines, spreading mass hysteria among the remaining alt furries.

|The Alt-Furries and the Tik-Tokkers continue their attacks, as terrorrist operations, murders, battles and much more happens everywhere on the world. 
The Alt-Furries re-conquer half of NYC, and start various operations to kill the King of Scandinavia.

In Scandinavia, various executions are interrupted, leaving the success rate at a rough 15.8%

[[The Crimson Fleet]] deploys 10 million troops to New York to assist The [[United States of Furries|USF]] in retaking the city. These troopers are assisted by 2 Atlas Class Super Carriers for air support and armor reinforcements should they need it. The Fleet also deploys 10 Hercules Class Carriers to Colorado to harass Alt-Furry forces.

The USF continues to push back the Alt's out of New York.

Terrified citizens all over the US continue to commit various crimes as a sign of despair and fear

[[New Spain]] deploys over 60 million units including those of the Catachan Jungle Fighters and the Cadian Shock Troops to force the Alts out of South America. The Alts despite fighting fiercely are severely outgunned and outnumbered by the superior Spanish fighting force that starts to force the scattered Alt Furry forces out of South America.

The Alts are pushed out of Asia. [[User:ChanChan69|Empress Chan]] meets with the General of the Alts who directed the attack against Asia, making a compromise with them. A treaty is sign and peace is declared between Asia and the Alts. 

The King of Scandinavia begins sending in the “Black Army” to help Push the Alt furries out of NYC, while the King of Scandinavia publicly beheads a captured Alt fur officer in NYC.

|September 4th, 2020
|Alt spies manage to gather info and copy Spaniard tech, so they can have bigger chances at defeating them
11 more assassination attempts happen, 1 leaves the King of Scandinavia wounded, but not severely

Despite the tech theft the Alts pulled on the Spanish, they are 75% forced out of South America due to the lack of quality the Alt knockoff tech presents, the greater number of Spanish units, and Spanish spies stealing Alt plans. While the Cadian guard faces troublesome resistance in the Andes, the Catachan Jungle Fighters live up to their name as many of the jungle territories are secured, it is even rumored the famous jungle fighter Sly Marbo is in this fight. Due to the tech theft, Spanish units are slowed down in the re-securing of their territories, however they are far from being completely stopped. The Alts try to regroup their South American forces to hold down the Andes knowing that the mountains will temporarily give proper defensive advantage for them. Meanwhile the God Emperor is still missing, rumored to be wreaking havoc behind enemy lines in search of his adopted son.

The Alts are pushed out of NYC again, and patrols and soldiers to guard the city have been tripled to prevent another recapture. Some of New Spain's Mordian Iron Guard and some of the 5th Reich's 95th Experimental squadron continue to provide support to the USF forces.

Dime reveals that the Alts sent a rushed cure for OWOliser to the DGR capital Nairobi which turned the receivers of the cure into zombies and that because of it Owang made sure to keep anymore of the rushed cure from reaching anymore DGR territory or beyond. Dime then gives Orange Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber as a final birthday gift as they begin to come up with a real cure for the OWOliser used on the protesters that started the war.

|September 5th, 2020 - As the Alts in South America take up defensive actions in the Andes, the Spanish bring in the Death Korps of Kriege who specialize in siege warfare. The Death Korps of Kriege begins to use their artillery experience to bombard the mountains while also slowly but surely pushing their lines into the mountains. Meanwhile, Alt Furry presence in Africa and Australia continues, seeing little resistance from the nations that occupy those lands.
The [[Democratic Republic of the Peninsula]] launches a surprise attack, as they were secretly mobilizing all this time and waiting for a chance. Peninsulan soldiers are given the order to shoot any Alts they identify. Meanwhile, citizens are rallied to start the South Africa Witch Hunt, the main objective to eliminate Talon and free South Africa.
[[Random city with walls number 1|Random Walled City Number 1]] is founded after an issue regarding latex monsters infesting a city forcing New Spain, NUA, and UNSC to reduce the city to where not even rubble remanded. Primarch K1374(Starfall) decided to take advantage of this to make a little operation that would generate money on the side for himself personally. K1374 ordered the building of the massive city using Spanish building technologies and techniques to create a medium-sized hive city for the purpose of earning himself money without his father (God Emperor) being able to control his flow of personal income. Due to the Alt war, the City is under intense security measures upping surveillance on its citizens and limiting what comes in and out. The Primarch despite building the city is unsure of where it is.

The Alts attempt to attack Salt Lake City, however, they are stopped by the NUA, Alameda Country, 5th Reich, and the USF. Meanwhile, New Spain and its Primarch K1374 invaded Denver due to the Alts being distracted with Salt Lake City. With a small regiment of Mordian Iron guard and the Primarch infiltrating the inside of the city, they caused massive disruption to the internal defences, thus allowed the Tallarn Desert Raiders, Scorpion heavy tanks, and S-protogen to come in at the city from all sides facing less resistance as the Alts would be attacked from the inside and outside. Eventually, the Spanish took Denver however despite their searches, Foxler was nowhere to be found (it is presumed he left for Australia). However, a Spanish patrol in Staten Island found Aeveirra hiding in a ditch as the New York battle died down a bit, the Grey Knights that found her sentenced her to death on the spot and broadcasted her rather brutal summary execution on live television in the name of the God-Emperor.

|Spanish forces in Denver catch Lex trying to escape the city. Much like Aeveirra in New York City, Lex is shown no mercy as he is summarily executed in a brutal manner on live television.

The Tasmania Witch Hunt ends, leaving Noble Can dead.

The Great Australian Witch Hunt ends in the death of at least 40,000 suspected witches and 35 high ranking Alt commanders, one of those deaths being that of Jolt Squirrel who was seen getting her spine ripped out by the Primarch K1374. The God Emperor raids an alt facility outside of Canberra and finds Dark Phox who was brutally abused to the point of permanent mental trauma. Both Dark Phox and the God Emperor return to the Imperial Palace in Barcelona.

|The DGR finishes working on its cure and tests it on all of the zombie civilians. The cure is declared a success, as it manages to make the zombies human again and get rid of the Alt-Furry urges caused by the OWOliser, and is shipped to all of the locations where people were affected by OWOliser. DGR Chief Orange Biker decides to go to his High Command to give the good news when he is greeted by guns pointing at him in the room. The DGR leaders then revealed themselves to be the Alt-Furry High Command, most of which were thought to be dead, and that they were controlling the DGR throughout this war. Alt-Furry soldiers in the room are then commanded to shoot Orange, only for there blaster fire to be deflected back at them via Orange using his saber sword and Luke's lightsaber, effectively killing some of them. Orange then deflected the blaster fire to the ceiling which created a hole he used to escape. The Alt-Furries then lock down the base in an attempt to prevent Orange from escaping. Foxler then ordered the awakening of the USF Protogen who were then told to execute Order 1488. This order makes the Protogen kill anyone who isn't an Alt-Furry or doesn't like Alt-Furries. The order also allows Protogen to gas Anti-Alt-Furry faction leaders in front of live audiences. The Protogen are able to murder most, if not, all of the soldiers in territories that the Alt-Furries were able to gain at the beginning of the war which allows the Alt-Furries to regain control of those countries. Meanwhile, Orange manages to sneak into his storage room and get Kenobi's lightsaber, which he mainly uses to get past most of the Alt-Furry forces and some of the Protogens. However, the Protogens manage to overwhelm Orange and nearly managed to kill him had Dime not intervened. After fighting through more enemies, P-2 manages to slice the entrance open and the group manage to escape the base. While Orange and Dime manage to escape Kenya in the Stinger Mantis, the rest of the DGR Police Force stay behind and swear that they will do everything in there power to liberate the DGR capital.
September 7th - The Death Korps of Krieg take all the Andean territory of New Spain, thus finally securing all Spanish territories in South America. Meanwhile New Spain readies 10 million of its forces as it plans to sometime invade Alt taken USF territories.

Several of New York City's buildings are engulfed in flames due to several bombs being lit across the city in a terrorist attack, with the fire spreading quickly via gas lines and spills. Two heavily armored men wielding Saritch 308's were spotted leaving one of the bombed buildings very shortly before the explosion. They were last seen heading out of the city.
|-
|September 8th, 2020
|Another explosion similar to that in NYC occurs in Nairobi. This attack did less damage than the last due to a quick response and containment of the fires, but large casualties and razing has still occurred. The same two armored men from the last attack were spotted leaving the city, and this time, some point to a supposed group known as the Contingency.
New Spain orders the bombing of multiple Protogen breeder facilities in India with its Phoenix space able bombers which are also capable of hypersonic cruising. The bombings destroyed 25% of the breeder facilities in India with most of the Phoenix bombers sent surviving the campaign. New Spain also orders the majority of its 60-120 million units to be on guard in case the Alts decide to invade South America again. Active air patrols and AA defenses are set up to ensure that Spanish airspace is protected from a possible retaliatory Alt aerial attack.

Meanwhile, still on the run, Orange Biker encounters another group of USF Protogen while going shopping. Orange is able to take some out with Kenobi's lightsaber but makes the foolish mistake of throwing the lightsaber at one of the Protogens which allows another to grab and crush the saber. Seeing as he is getting increasingly outnumbered, Orange uses his saber sword and Luke's lightsaber in a desperate attempt at defeating his enemies only to get dogpiled and nearly ripped to shreds by the many Protogens around him. However, just like last time, Dime manages to save Orange while using the Force to bring the groceries into the Stinger Mantis. Before going in with Dime, Orange grabs Kenobi's lightsaber and takes it with him, with the group escaping yet again. Now having some time to think, Orange sees that the lightsaber's crystal is broken and no longer works. Concurrently, Lila and Mii, who are taking Dime's place, let the group know about the terrorist attacks. This raises the stakes for the group more than ever now. Out of options, the Mantis lands in the Cyromancer Legion's village and it's crew relax in it for sometime.

[[The Pyromancer Regime]] officially declares war on the Alts, taking the place of the RSEL.

Immediately after declaring war, four Alt spies sneak onto the Ryukuan Islands. They are discovered, and put down.


One Avenger class grand cruiser and two Sword class frigates, all of which are void shielded use their plasma bombards on Alt SDI systems located in northern India, destroying nearly all of them thus allowing the three ships to enter the atmosphere and hover low over Northeastern Uttar Pradesh. Along with the three ships came thousands of Vampire Raider space able drop ships that landed hundreds of thousands of troops and hundreds of Warhound class titans as well as many Nightwing space able fighters to further AA defense for the grouping of the Spanish forces. Thousands of Spanish tanks of multiple kind would fly out of the ships to secure a landing zone for infantry and Titans. Phoenix bombers would also be used on nearby airfields, especially those in Delhi, Lucknow, Agra, Kanpur, and Patna, destroying many of the Alts nearby heavy aircraft capabilities (such as bombers and gunships), forcing them to rely on flying in heavy aircraft from further away. Meanwhile the Alts in India begin moving forces to defend many of their important inland industries, especially those that breed protogen. These actions sign the beginning of the Great Indian Crusade, lead by the famous Spanish [[Ciaphas Cain|Commissar Ciaphas Cane]] who is known as the Hero of the Imperium, it is said that Commissar Cain is on the front lines fighting along side his mostly S-protogen men.

Orange Biker ends up exploring a ice cave in the Cryomancer Legion village which nearly costs him his life but gets him two kyber crystals. One for fixing and upgrading Kenobi's lightsaber and renaming it (them) "Peace and Justice", and another for the light dagger which is a different color from the crystal it uses. Orange then goes to the village's restaurant to get some food to heat his body up.

In Kenya, Foxler, going by the name of Lee Allen Miller as the new chief of the DGR, makes a secret deal with Netflix which involves the sexualization of children. The DGR Resistance, led by Lila and Mii Yoshida, learn of the deal and prevent it from taking full action.

Spanish and Alt forces in India clash with each other near many of the northern urban centers in India, at this point the Spanish have brought in a few lower millions of units out of 10 million total thus far. Many of the forces hold a front line north of many of the major inland urban areas in India, some of the forces are part of the Death Korps of Kriege, a unit that specializes in holding front lines. The Spanish decide to focus an attack on the city of Lucknow as they send over S-protogen and Thunder-gen, light armored vehicles, Warhound Titans, and members of the Mordian Iron Guard. Precision Vampire Hunter strikes deal blows to most of the outer northern defenses of the city, allowing the Spanish to not have to worry about much resistance entering the city, however it is a different story fighting in the city itself.

|A group of friendly Gundead, known as: [[The Shells of the Forgotten Bullet]], has officially join in the war. Believing that the Gundead should do other things, than defending a lost relic, now that the Gungeoneers has it, and the Gungeon has collaspe. Their leaders are siding with the Gamers, and will be wiling to supply their weapons and knowledge of Ammomancy to the Gamers.
After getting renamed multiple times, Chief Lee Allen Miller (Foxler) reorganizes the Democratic Gamer Republic into the United Monke Republic, transforming the Parliamentary Democracy into an Autocratic Dictatorship. As Lee's first order as Dictator, he orders the search of Orange Biker and his immediate execution. The Protogens eventually find Orange and his group, forcing them and the Cryomancer Legion to fight them off. They eventually do, winning the battle. Orange decides enough is enough and returns to Kenya with his group and the Cryomancer Legion, who have declared war on the Alt-Furries due to the aforementioned battle, to help the resistance group that is made up of what used to be the DGR Police Force and half of the DGR Soldiers. This starts the [[Battle of Kenya]].



The Spanish forces in India run into resistance that mounts in Lucknow as the S-protogen and Mordian guard push further into the city. As the Alts begin to siphon units up from the southern India and from other cities in the Northern area into Lucknow, the Spanish break lines and invade the cities of New Delhi, Agra, and Patna with Astartes and Thunder-gen as many of the Alt forces have diverted from those cities to assist in the defense of Lucknow. One Sword class frigate travels with the group invading New Delhi and another travels with the group invading Patna to provide the area with long range artillery strikes. Despite the number advantage of the Alts, their USF protogen are far inferior to the S-protogen who not only are equipped with a wide variety of advanced systems for better overall combat performance, but the S-protogen are also fluent in every martial arts pattern as well as being expert tacticians that can function both well as individuals and a collective. As a result, the number of Alt USF protogen it has taken to kill one S-protogen on average has been so far high. Commisar Ciaphas Cane has been seen on the front lines in Lucknow as he has racked up many kills against Alt forces with his boltgun and chainsword while at the same time giving much positive reinforcement to his mostly S-protogen and Mordian Guarsmen men. The Spanish launch a Phoenix bombing campaign against Kenya after hearing there are breeder facilities there, however the concentration of Alt forces there has only reduced protogen breeding productivity by 5% in Kenya. Because of this, the Alt-Furries place shields on the remaining facilites in Kenya to protect them from more bombings. As for Spain itself, New Spain launches an assault from Barcelona totaling over 5 million units, including three Imperator class titans and many Custodes and Custodes-gen.

New Spain manages to secure all of Lucknow and most of Patna, Agra, Kanpur, and New Delhi as the S-protogen and Adeptus Astares outperform the USF protogen, however the Alts start to prioritize protection of New Delhi due to its large industry and thus send many of its forces there giving the New Delhi invaders more trouble than usual. The Spanish also begin to invade Ludhiana, Calcutta, and Dhaka as the Spanish land more forces across the provinces of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. As the Spanish start to take Lucknow, Patna, Agra, Kanpur, and New Delhi all of which holding many large protogen breeding facilities important to the Alts, many of these facilities are outright destroyed by the Spanish thus further reducing the protogen production capacity of the Alts in India by 1/3. This reduces some of the power of the Alts as India holds the most USF protogen breeder facilities compared to anywhere else, however with the acquisition of the DGR, the destruction of the Northern Indian breeder facilities is so far not enough. Meanwhile in Spain, the city of Zaragoza and Valencia come under attack by Spanish forces, including two of the Imperator Titans and even some Reaver class titans. The Alts try to defend said cities against the Spanish, however the Custodes take on many of their units well with a ratio of one Custodes lost to 2,000 Alt units. As for the Imperator titans, they rampage through the Spanish countryside inflicting mass casualty on the enemy while the enemy can barely put much of a drain on the Imperator titans void shielding.

The Battle of Kenya ends in the destruction of the UMR and the reformation of the DGR.

A group of Alt Soldiers attempting to escape Kenya are caught by the HECU and Pyromancer Units. Most of the unit is wiped out, but leaves 3 soldiers dead.


It is soon realized that not all of the Alt Navy has been destroyed as a large fleet departs India for Europe, presumably for retaliation against the Spanish for assisting heavily in the war efforts against the Alts even though the Alts did minimal to the Spanish. Meanwhile another fleet but smaller leaves Spain and heads for India, the industrial crown jewel of the Alts as it is rumored that the fleet leaving Spain contains the high ranking Alts from Europe. Meanwhile the Spanish fully secure all of Patna, Agra, Kanpur, and secure most of Ludhiana, Calcutta, and Dhaka. The Spanish start having trouble with New Delhi so they send in the Avenger class grand cruiser over to the forces holding their lines near New Delhi to provide long range artillery support and AA support. The Spanish then begin to invade Jaipur, Ahmedabad,Chittagong, Rajkot, and Indore. Airbases across much of Southern India are bombed by Spanish phoenix bombers reducing the Alt standard airpower in India by 25% and heavy airpower by 75%. As the new cities are taken, more of the protogen output of the Alts is decreased, meanwhile Commissar Ciaphas Cain comes up with an idea while in New Delhi. Meanwhile in Spain, the three titans and the many Custodes manage to butcher through Zaragoza and Valencia with the help of the Primarch. The three titans and their groups of Custodes/Custodes-gen split off for Bilbao, Madrid, and Murica. Alt forces in Spain have mostly left with the fleet that was detected first by the Robloxians.

All of Ludhiana, Calcutta, and Dhaka are captured as the cities of Jaipur, Ahmedabad,Chittagong, Rajkot, and Indore are taken mostly, New Delhi on the other hand has been giving issue. The Cities of Nagpur, Bhopal, and Visakhapatnam are invaded by Spanish forces who now have brought over 3/4 of the 10 million forces they had planned for the Great Indian Crusade, meanwhile one of the Sword class frigates assists forces in the province of Gujarat, the other assist in the province of Odisha, and the Avenger class grand cruiser continues assisting forces near New Delhi as the forces there prepare for a siege. Meanwhile Phoenix bombers attack multiple sites in Thiruvananthapuram and Nagercoil before an Endeavor class light cruiser and two Claymore class corvettes all void shielded come out of orbit and begin deploying Astartes, Thunder-gen, and Warhound titans at a landing site in between the two cities as the void ships above provide fire and AA support. Meanwhile the Alts begin fortifying Ceylon as they begin sending troops into Ceylon from India for a defense, not to mention that the Alt fleet from Spain manages to get to Ceylon presumably bringing many of the important Alt leaders of Europe and many of the European forces to the now fortified island.

|Captain Franku Clean threatens the Kingdom of Scandinavia, and the King of Scandinavia threatens to give Franku a gruesome and painful death if he even tries.


After herding much of the Alt fleet heading for Spain into the Strait of Gibraltar, the Spanish Sword class frigates and ''Lunar''-class heavy assault cruisers disengage the enemy and pull into orbit, the Alts are confused as to why this happened despite the Spanish taking very minimal loss. However in orbit already are two Apocalypse class Battleships who rain down their sun hot plasma bombards on the enemy ships, evaporating all of the close together attacking fleet completely all from orbit, thus preventing the Alts from invading Catalonia. With the death of Foxler by the RSEL, the dwindling breeding capacity of Protogen due to the Spanish's Great Indian Crusade, the fall of the UMR and reinstating of the DGR, and the decimation of their fleets by both the NUA Florida engagement and the Spanish Gibraltar engagement, the Alts begin diverting many of their forces and leadership to Ceylon in preparation for a possible last stand should they be unable to hold out on what lands they have left anymore.

It plans to operate in countries all over the world, except for [[New Spain]] and [[The Empire of Japan]].


New Spain becomes the [[New Spain|Imperium of Mankind]]


The Imperium of Mankind drives all remaining Alt furries out of India, at least 10 Avenger class grand cruisers blockade Ceylon preventing any Alts there from escaping into the Bear Republic. The Imperium also activates the false Tyranid psychic hivemind pulse as it is time to begin the siege of Ceylon, this causes multiple genestealer cults in Ceylon to rise up against the Alts stationed there in a rather organized way. Over the past five days since the first genestealers were dropped in Ceylon, they have managed to infect 37% of the people there with the Tyranid gene, causing those 37% of people in Ceylon to become highly organized and aggressive to anyone who was not infected with the tyranid gene. This has lead to multiple cases of murder and rioting in Ceylon as the genestealer cults begin to fight against the Alts there and anyone who lacks the Tyranid gene. The [[New Spain|Imperium of Mankind]] also pays the USF for any damages caused to India after they secured it.

Taking this as a threat to his status, Bill has the boy beaten, tortured and skinned alive. When tribesmen under the former chieftain objected, Bill had them decapitated and their village burned. The 5th Riech allowed this because of the young chieftains threats to take over the region.
After this brutality, Billious was given the title of "War God", note this is merely a title to emphasize his brutal reputation, not anything to do with worship. 

The Bear Republic continues to execute those who spread hate as well as any and all Alts within their borders that can be found. Protests are calmed by police and politicians who explain their methods are only to progress the defeat of the Alts and the neutrality of the Bear Republic.

The Shells of the Forgotten Bullet, has begun rebuilding the Gungeon, on earth, over at the Arctic. But they have allowed some of the members to fight in the war of the Confederacy vs the 5th Reich. 

The DGR learns that Hydra managed to rebuild the Triskelion. Because of this, Orange Biker sends Dime and the Bad Batch (Ryoshi, Rekka, Tekku, and Juji) to the headquarters in order to prevent what almost happened in 2014 again. In addition, Orange lets P-2 go with Dime in order to gather information from the headquarters. Going as Shield agents, Dime with P-2 and the Bad Batch fly down in a Quinjet from a Shield Helicarrier to the Triskelion and kill all of the Alt-Furries and Hydra agents outside and inside of the headquarters. When reinforcements come via Hydra Troop Transports (HTTs) from a Hydra Helicarrier that begins shooting at the Shield Helicarrier, causing the two helicarriers to shoot at each other, Juji snipes at some of the Alt reinforcements while the rest of the Bad Batch fight them on the ground and P-2, under the watch of Dime, hacks into the Triskelion computers and attempts to gain as much information as he can. When the reinforcements start getting into the Triskelion, P-2 manages to activate a message in one of the computers. When hearing the name, Dime realized her theory is true. That a member of what used to be her syndicate, Tee Kanker, was indeed alive, even though he was believed to be killed during the Battle in Japan. While in shock, Ryoshi tells Dime it is time to go due to the Alts regaining their headquarters. Dime and the Bad Batch manage to defeat all of the reinforcements as the Hydra Helicarrier is shot down. While returning to the Shield Helicarrier, Dime, P-2, and the Bad Batch watch the Hydra Helicarrier crash into the Triskelion from the Quinjet, witnessing the recreation of what actually happened in 2014.

|The Imperium of Mankind successfully takes most of the coast of Ceylon with the thunder-gen and Adeptus Astertes, this allows the Imperium to land in S-protogen and Cadian Shock Troops to make up the bulk of the assaulting force of Ceylon. With at least a total of 100,000 S-protogen and Cadian guardsmen at the ready, they advance along with the pre existing Astartes and Thunder-gen forces already there. At least 200 Night Spinner main battle tanks are deployed all over Ceylon along with 75 Warhound class Titans and 25 Reaver class titans to go with the 100,000 guardsmen and 20,000 Astartes/Thunder-gen.
Dime tells Orange Biker about Tee Kanker and how the Alts might be using his strategies against the DGR. Dime also tells Orange that Tee is in Camp Lehigh. Orange, P-2, Dime, and the Bad Batch travel to the Hydra base in the Stinger Mantis. After getting inside the base and to the lower level via the elevator, the group manage to defeat the first wave of Alt-Furries and Hydra agents. After this, the group splits up. Orange and P-2 go left, where they will gather some more information, Dime and Tekku go right, where she hopes to save Tee, and the rest of the Bad Batch run through the center, killing every Alt that gets in their way. P-2 manages to gather some information when he and Orange are confronted by a dark figure. The figure reveals himself to be Jakob Hitler, grandson of Adolf Hitler, pulls out his lightsaber and begins dueling with Orange. Meanwhile, Dime and Tekku manage to find Tee all plugged up to different machines. Tekku, with the help of Juan Gonzales (not the baseball player), the main hacker of the DGR who was apart of Dime's Syndicate, tries to free Tee from the computers. Meanwhile, Orange continues dueling with Jakob. Orange manages to cut Jakob's mask, revealing part of his face. Jakob then decides to take off his mask, revealing that he looks more Aryan than his grandfather before him, and continues dueling with Orange. Meanwhile, the Bad Batch manage to defeat all of the Alts and make it to a bunker. Inside the bunker, they find Arnim Zola. However, this is a copy of him since the original was destroyed in 2014. Arnim, realizing that his subject is being released, shocks Tee, causing him to feel immense pain as he gets information deprived from him. The remaining Alts receive the strategy sent to them by Arnim and begin to try to use it on the Bad Batch with no success, as they are able to beat many of the strategies thrown at them. Rekka decides to destroy Arnim, freeing Tee from the pain and the machines. Dime and Tekku then carry Tee out of the room. Meanwhile, running out of options, Orange force slows Jakob and throws a missile bomb at him, flinging him back and hurting him badly. Orange then takes advantage of this and escapes the base with the rest of the group, and they all fly in the Stinger Mantis back to Kenya. Dime then asked if Tee was okay, and he said yes but also noted that he felt like he had someone stuck inside his head.

|Back in Kenya, Tee Kanker is analyzed for anything out of the ordinary. After the analysis, it is reported that there are no differences to Tee's brain, albeit a lobotomy which was plugged up via technological enhancements. In addition to that, he has a prosthetic left hand that can transform into a scomp link. The information collected from Camp Lehigh reveals that Tee was used as an experiment and, had he continued to be used for his strategies, Hydra would have continued to add technological enhancements to him until he would be a new, more powerful vessel for Arnim Zola. The information also reveals that the Alts are waiting over Kenya in a Hydra Star Destroyer, waiting for a new strategy to be sent. Tee hatches a plan in which he would plug himself into the Star Destroyer's machine and send out a strategy to the Alts, which would make them go to the capital in an attempt to raid it. However, the DGR military would know of this and corner the Alts, shooting them all down to their surprise. Orange, Dime, Tee, and the Bad Batch execute the plan successfully, after sneaking in to the Star Destroyer via the Stinger Mantis. However, after learning of the plan, the Admiral of the Star Destroyer ordered the shocking of the systems, causing Tee to get shocked into unconsciousness. However, once he wakes up, Tee isn't himself but rather Arnim taking control of his mind and body due to being connected to it for so long. Arnim's time in Tee's body is cut short once Dime is able to punch them, making him unconscious once again. Hatching a backup plan, the Bad Batch dealt with all of the Alts on the ship while Tekku plugged Tee back into the machine, allowing Juan Gonzales to transfer Arnim from Tee's body into the Star Destroyer. While this gives Arnim control of the entire Star Destroyer, however, it allows Juan to restrict Arnim, allowing the group to escape. During the mission on the Star Destroyer, P-2 collected more information while Orange found a button on the Star Destroyer which would cause it to self destruct and allows Rekka to press it. Extremely happy, Rekka presses it and cause the Star Destroyer to explode, killing everyone else in it, including Arnim. During the trip back home, Tee revealed that his mind feels free now. When the group returned, Tee decided to join the Bad Batch, since he has a difference of his own now. 


As Imperium forces push further into Ceylon, Primarch K1374 unleashes a psychic signal to all undead and genestealer cultist in Ceylon causing all their heads to explode. While the complete killing of both undead and genestealers allowed the Alt furries there to partially recover in Ceylon, defeat seems to be drawing closer and closer as the Imperum not only has sent in Ciaphas Cain, but also Sly Marbo and members of the Catachan Jungle fighters.

Dime, with the permission of Orange Biker, buys 1.2 million Battle Protogens from Commie's Weaponry and Protogen, with plans to buys millions more later on. Dime places George's usb into one of the protogens, giving him a body once again.

The Alt-Furries in California are holding up a good chunk of the state, resisting the Bear Republic's forces. Because of this, the DGR army, led by Orange Biker, travel to California in an attempt to defeat the Alt-Furries there. The DGR army manages to do this, forcing the Alt-Furries in California to cause a bombing run in order to escape. The DGR army begins cleaning up the city for the Bear Republic when Orange finds a neko. He follows the neko to an abandoned alleyway, where he finds the neko mourning. Orange comforts the neko right before they are found by a DGR soldier. The neko introduces herself as Anne and the group meet up with the other DGR soldiers.

The two begin dueling once again with Dime spectating and waiting for P-2 to be finished collecting the data. Orange and Jakob were fighting extremely rough with Orange taking the defense most of the time while Jakob took the offense. Dime only interfered when Orange was close to defeat. The two stopped fighting once they ran out of energy. Luckily, this was at the time the Bad Batch defeated all of the Alts and P-2 collected all of the data, allowing Dime to drag Orange out of the base.

However, it is unknown whether it was actually Trump, who was believed to be killed at the beginning of the 1st Furry War, or an imposter. After the message was broadcast, Jakob Hitler invaded Soviet Russia with some Hydra soldiers and manages to kill many Soviets in the process. Jakob then goes to the Kremlin and finds a Wayfinder, an old relic from a bygone era, which he believes will lead him to Trump and allow him to slaughter the former U.S. President, preventing anyone else from coming into power.

During the dogfight, Baron Maroon managed to take control of Hoda’s Y-Wing, forcing it to attack Daiba. However, after Daiba shot the Baron's Tie multiple times, he loses control of the Y-Wing, allowing Hoda to intervene every now and then once again. Meanwhile, in Russia, the DGR learns that [https://gvf-war.fandom.com/wiki/Lukas_Chrom Lukas Chrom] is being heavily guarded by world eaters and Hydra soldiers in the Kremlin because he is working on an A.I. that can help take down an opponent pilot by any means necessary. Even through sabotage. Because of this, the DGR sends most of it's forces, including Orange Biker himself, Dime, the Bad Batch, the DGR military, and the DGR special forces, to deal with the combined strength of the group of world eaters and Hydra soldiers inside and outside of the Kremlin. The DGR soldiers manage to plow through the opposing forces and make their way into the Kremlin. However, Dabia's shield power is running out and she can't handle Baron Maroon for much longer, with the only thing saving her being a fly distracting the Baron for 2 minutes. After receiving this message, Orange goes into what used to be the office of Vladimir Putin and kills all of the world eaters and Hydra soldiers in there in the process. Orange also manages to destroy the machine the A.I. is in, causing Baron Maroon to lose track of Dabia when she makes a left turn in between buildings. This allows Dabia to fly in front of Baron Maroon afterwards, allowing her to shoot the Baron down and watch as he crashes into a building. Happy about her new feat, Dabia flies in lightspeed until she reaches Russia. Once there, she sees the same Star Destroyer with the rumored superweapon coming out of it, preparing to fire. Because of this, Daiba shoots a missile into the barrel of the superweapon, and escapes just as it explodes, causing the Star Destroyer to fall onto the Kremlin just as the DGR forces got out. After this, a group of GR-75 medium transports picked up the forces and returned them to the Temperance, where they all celebrate their victory.

However, when he touches it, he gets forced into a vision where he is fighting Trump. After defeating the President turned God Emperor, Orange gets jumped by all of Trump’s Loyalists, both dead and alive. The vision then takes Orange to a mirror. Orange sticks his hand into the mirror but can’t get it out. After some tugging, Orange pulled his hand out of the mirror. However, he also pulled out a Dark Side version of himself, looking like an Inquisitor, which he is forced to fight.

The duel continues once again, with Orange using a variety of moves against Jakob. However, they don’t prove much use as, due to being weaken by NNN, Jakob manages to defeat Orange and nearly kill him. However, he is stopped from doing so for unknown reasons. Taking advantage of this, Orange used a Force power on Jakob he rarely used, Force probing, in order to learn where Pol is. While gaining this information, Orange also learned something which might have united the two brothers. Orange then returned to the Stinger Mantis. Hearing things, Jakob entered where the broken window was and saw a vision of his grandfather, Adolf Hitler.

The tank is blown up, and RSEL troops rappel from helicopters to take offensive formation. They manage to hold off the attackers for long enough to crest a nearby hill and see what is causing the heat signatures: a massive missile silo, at least a mile and a half wide, and an accompanying nuclear reactor. Nearby flags seem to denote the facility is of Brony origin. The rest of the RSEL military is alerted and mobilized.

The bombers, accompanied by fighters, begin runs on trenches on the ground, but AA cannons force them to retreat after about 20 minutes of bombardment. RSEL artillery counters this, for a time, destroying a few AA guns. Brony foot soldiers straying beyond the trench network are cut down by arriving tanks. However, the tanks severely damaged by minefields. This forces the RSEL to directly drop troops from helicopters onto the trenches. This, despite many casualties, works, and the outer perimeter of the facility is held. 


Before RSEL troops can advance any more, a single missile is fired from the silo directly onto the trench network the RSEL division was occupying. The missile did not explode completely, however, but began to leak a toxic gas. WIthin moments, the RSEL troops in the area were caught under some variant of Brony conversion gas. The few non-poisoned RSEL troops began to retreat, but were killed by their brothers. The commander of the group is executed by Brony commanders. 


Messages are sent to the RSEL by the Bronies that, quote, "A new age of the Brony Empire has begun. You may either join us in our conquest of world domination, or be destroyed. With this new conversion gas, we can sway millions to our cause. " The missile silo then emptied the rest of their missiles at various targets around the world, including the DGR, Brotherhood of Steel, 5th Reich, Kyotian Empire, UPK, and more, causing civilians in the area of effect to become zombie-like Bronies. This act of aggression begins the creation of a new faction: The Neo-Bronies, or the New Kingdom. This also begins the 2nd Brony War.

|After a year of planning, the shattered Brony Empire rallies, calling themselves the New Kingdom. Using a new variant of Brony Conversion Gas, they launch missiles strikes at multiple factions across the world, causing the spread of a zombie-like outbreak. These zombies are completely loyal to the Brony cause, and possess the competence to act in a tactical manor, as well as wield weaponry. Any still-loyal Bronies across the world rally, bringing their military numbers to approximately 13,200,000, not counting the 3,500,000 infected (and rising, as zombies can infect others by biting them/causing zombie blood to enter their bloodstream) Continued strikes against the Soviet Union and RSEL continue, as well as the beginning of air strikes against the Brotherhood of Steel and 5th Reich.
    
The UPK and Kyotian Empire systematically eradicate their infected at a slow pace whilst beginning to synthesize an antidote. Both nations declare neutrality in the war, focusing on themselves. The bodies of the infected are shipped to the territory of Brazil for the time being. Eradication continues swimmingly but gradually whilst cure research continues. The UPK and Empire also enforce nationwide lockdowns to stop the spread of the plague, with face masks becoming much more popular in the fashion industry. Kyotian and UPK officials do not raise alarm to the new war, stating that it has nothing to do with Asia, and appoint a well-informed doctor as a spokesperson to give updates on the virus and cure research.               

Work on a second version of the conversion gas begins to counter anti-drug research, despite the drug resistance of the current gas virus. The New Kingdom largely focuses on America, Europe and Antarctica for the time, despite a few weapon runs by Black Sun against the Kyotian Empire.            

The [[Ruby Shadows]] are unaffected by the gas as Vampires are immune to all diseases and chemicals while the flesh buds overpower the effects of the chemicals while adapting even further to resist should a stronger dosage occur, thus keeping familiars loyal to the Ruby Shadows. Seeing opportunity, the Ruby Shadows amidst the chaos begin to silently convert many convert Brony Zombies, turning them into familiars as the flesh buds overpower the chemicals. The familiars are checked for any kind of tracking devices and removed of them inside and out before they are shipped out to some place unknown.    

More missile strikes occur against multiple factions, and the number of infected begins to rise as a scramble for a cure begins. Mass recruiting begins on the part of the Bronies.  

In response to the Bronies stealing many of their aircraft, the USGR declare war on the Bronies and send a squadron after them in order to test their strength.    

The New Kingdom meets the squadron over Easter Island while they were on patrol. The squadron of 5 began to duel with a squadron of air fighters, aided by a single destroyer. The F-35 fighters fire missiles equipped with specialty Ion pulses, which disables the fighters duels. Despite the loss of 9 F-35s, the New Kingdom triumphs, forcing the last surviving fighter, Echo Three, to retreat.

|Emboldened by their small victory, the Bronies launch a full-scale invasion of the Bear Republic's territory in California, their main goal being Burbank, the former Brony capital. Brony troops deploy in San Francisco and Santa Barbara, and meet heavy Bear Republic opposition. Additional assaults occur in the RSEL territory of Alaska, and bombing begins on RSEL facilities there. 


After the two Brony assaults on San Francisco and Santa Barbara occur, Brony destroyers shell Bear Republic beachheads near Los Angelis, destroying many bunkers. Bronies take the nearby beaches, then launching a missile with Conversion Gas upon Los Angelis. The city is overrun, despite Bear Republic opposition, but many thousands of infected are eliminated. 


The Brony invasion of San Francisco fails, despite heavy Bear Republic casualties, and Bronies retreat from the area to further reinforce territories taken at Santa Barbara and Los Angelis. The Bronies move in to Los Angelis, sending infected out to kill remaining Bear Republic enforcements. The Bear Republic regiment in the area rallies in a network of bunkers in the Mojave Desert, and heavy fighting begins there. 


Bronies launch a large assault on Perth, Australia. Multiple missiles are launched in the city, forcing Brotherhood forces to retreat. The Aperture Science foundry there is put on lockdown, and as many non-infected civilians as possible are evacuated. The city is placed on lockdown. M00NDUST authorizes the creation of the B.W.C.D, or Biological Warfare Control Division, to combat the attack and any more that may occur. Brony troops from Antarctica move in to attack Tasmania, a shared territory between Cryomancers and the Brotherhood. The two factions fight together, successfully repelling the invaders and sinking 3 warships before they retreat. 


Perth is secured by the Brotherhood, but Bronies push in from the north. Heavy fighting begins in the air between Brony air divisions and the Brotherhood Orbital Supremacy Corps in multiple districts near Perth. 

The [[Ruby Shadows]] continue their own conversions of people into loyal familiars amidst where there is chaos.  

The USSR pushes Bronies off of Russian soil, any Brony protest stop and are ended. The Bronies end up with massive casualties, and are forced to retreat. Most of the force returns to their heat sink in Antarctica.      

Multiple banks in Mumbai are shot at, resulting in money and briefcases flying out the windows as the banks burn for some reason. The Money and briefcases are loaded onto multiple Achilies ridgerunner IFVs, though despite the oddity that the banks were repetitively shot at instead of just sacked, the only answer for this odd situation is that is just how mafia works.  

Hydra abducts several people from the [[United Scientocratic Gamer Republic]] for Project Dark Trooper. This is due to the fact that Hydra was unaware of the USGR's name change. The USGR use this to track down Hydra.  

The same person who came up with Non-Stop Nut November creates a new challenge for December called Devour Donut December. The USGR intends to participate in this challenge, wanting to start to eat something other than sandwiches.  

The Bronies continue to push into RSEL territory, taking a few more miles around their Antarctic base.     

The Siege of Alaska begins, as the RSEL troops there have been cut off by both the New Kingdom and New Kingdom-allied Bladewalkers in Canada.     

Attacks continue on Brotherhood soil, but New Kingdom fighter planes are largely defeated by Brotherhood starfighters. While the Ion missiles fired by New Kingdom planes can deactivate ACTIS-I Interceptors, they do almost no damage against TIE Daggers, which are unshielded. Because of this, most TIE Daggers gain the upper hand in ship-to-ship dogfights. Bombing begins on New Kingdom destroyers in the Australian Bight, and 10 squadrons of Brotherhood fighters and a Venator Star Destroyer are sent to aid the RSEL in Australia.      

The New Kingdom and Poland Resistance for an alliance, one the resistance soon regrets. They plan to leave the alliance as soon as possible.

In the lab, Biker finds a futa child who is about to get mutilated until Biker intervenes. After this discovery, Biker encounters Rudy Giuliani, who reveals to Biker that Hydra created the lab in order to make him think that his father was up to no good. Giuliani also reveals that the lab was used in the early trials of Project Dark Trooper, only to be abandoned after the tests failed, turning all of the subjects into futas. However, months after the initial tests, the futas would be tortured for their tears and mutilated for their blood in order to help with the project that was actually covered up by the real Project Dark Trooper, which involved the creation of advanced robots seen during the end of the Great Scouring.
