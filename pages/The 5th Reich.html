The 5th Reich is a global Ultilitarian-Communist superpower concentrated in Germany with its capital at Berlin. They mainly fight in the European theater, but have been seen in Africa, Asia, Australia, and Antarctica. While not officially in the UGR, they are allies and often assist them in battle.

== History ==
Germany used to be under the control of [[Fascist State of Countryhumans|Countryhumans]] who ruled the lands without uprisings. Before, the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] had taken [[Eastern Germany]], and it led to the [[ Siege of Berlin]]. But then, a Countryhuman invasion backed up by [[The Furries|furries]] forced the Soviets out of Germany, and the Countryhumans were now in control. However, some civilians did not like the Countryhumans, and civilians were still influenced by communism from the Soviets instead of a fascist dictatorship they were under. Small uprisings began and became more popular until [[The Warsaw Massacre]]. Civilians were enraged about the actions of the Countryhumans, and revolts became much more common and more violent. It is around this period of time that a resistance group called: "The 5th Reich‚Äú was made. They planned for [[The Blitz]], a bombing raid aided by the USGR to help them take back Germany and finish off with a ground invasion. The operation was a success, and The 5th Reich established a Utilitarian-Communist Government and United Germany Under the new Government.

== Military Forces ==
(Note that this equipment ranges from the Resistance to its modern-day shape. Some may have been replaced by The 5th Reich already!) Many military forces resign within The 5th Reich. These range from Th original resistance groups to the powerful Kriegsmarine. Here are some of their forces:

== Involvement In the War ==
The 5th Reich is a crucial stronghold for the front in Europe as that means that gamers have a stable and capable fighting force planted in Europe. As the 5th Reich grew stronger, many experimental "Projekts" as The 5th Reich would call them would be made and then shipped to the front lines for combat. Countless projects have been made, but only a select few can actually view them. The gamers have made contracts and asked for many of their own projects to be completed. The 5th Reich also has a grand fleet that has naval superiority in the Atlantic and Mediterranean oceans. Although the number of ships and the number of men to pilot these things are classified, it is estimated by others to be almost 2x bigger than the Wehrmacht. The Luftwaffe also has complete air superiority and is only matched by the squadrons made by the infamous furry Shovel De' Spadefish including the 513th Ruby Regiment, which have since been disbanded after the infamous furry‚Äòs death.

== Deutsche Kosmische Flotte ==
The Deutsche Kosmische Flotte (German Cosmic Fleet) is the 5th Reich‚Äòs space Navy. It‚Äôs main purposes are space exploration, the defense of Germany, and supporting Allies of the Reich. It‚Äôs headquarters in Hamburg, and is also where most of the Fleet‚Äôs ships are stationed. It also has bases on the moon, Venus, and Mars. The Ships of the German Cosmic Fleet are Powered by dimensional Wave Motion Engines, which makes the Ships capable of warping through time and space at lightspeed. most of these ships also use a weapon known as the wave motion gun, which is powered by the Wave Motion Engine And is capable of wiping out entire fleets the size of the Australia. Some of these ships are even equipped with two or even three Wave Motion Guns.{{Navy-Fleet|title1 = German Cosmic Fleet|image1 = 3008D128-2A52-4E19-A47F-4F4A5B468B36.jpeg|caption1 = Flag of the German Cosmic Fleet|admiral = Erich Von Bleinspeiler|stationed_at = Hamburg|port = Many|founded = June 20, 2020|founder = The 5th Reich Ministry of Air and Space|ships_when_founded = 70|number_of_ships = Yes|number_of_men = Classified}}

== Experiments ==
Many experiments were done by the 5th Reich. Some are detailed here, but most are classified and will wait until the information is released to the public.

=== [[Projekt Anschluss]] ===
Projekt Anschluss (otherwise known as Executive Order 005) is an Experimental tank that uses Stalinium, Titanium, and many more incredibly durable metals mixed together to have the most armored tank in the 5th Reich. It has many systems unseen before such as self-destruct mechanisms, an automatically rotating turret, self-loading mechanism, and speed. Projekt Anschluss also goes by numerous other names such as the E-200 and Tiger 3 tank. Testing goes on in facilities specifically made for the tank. It‚Äôs produced in other factories run by B-17, a member of the Memers. It also has many armed guards from the Tailbiters (although they have been replaced by soviet and 5th Reich forces after hostility), making it one of the most protected secrets of the Reich.

=== Experiment 13 ===
Experiment 13 saw a captured Russian Countryhuman be sprayed with Adidas Body Spray and have him consume Mountain Dew. Approximately 10 seconds after consuming the Mountain Dew, the subject began screaming for about 10 minutes before passing out. During his sleep, he transformed from a Countryhuman to a Slavic man in roughly 5 minutes. Another 5 minutes later, he woke up with a small memory of his Past. The Slavic became a Gopnik and enjoys drinking vodka with his friends at apartments near Stuggart.
=== Projekt Donner Reagen ===

Projekt Donner Reagen is an experimental bomber made to replace the outdated ME-264 bombers still in service. The ME-264 bombers were turned into gunships while some still remained in service. The bomber itself is highly classified but has gone on many missions. The Donner Reagen is yet another example of how well the Germans can research, make, produce, and use their assets in their military efforts. In November of 2018 it was discontinued and put Out of Service due to lack of usage. most Donner Reagen Bombers were scrapped and used to build other aircraft. A few are kept in museums across Germany.

=== Die Unterwasser-Roketenboot a.k.a Projekt Neptuns Dreizack ===

Sometime after The Northeastern German Campaign, 5th Reich second in command Oskar M√ºller suggests that the 5th Reich Kriegsmarine should make a Missile version of the ‚ÄúFritz X‚Äù Guided Bomb. Erich agrees with this and orders the Kriegsmarine build a Rocket powered Fritz X that can be launched from ships and planes. Erich also orders the building of a new type of U-Boat that will be able to launch a large amount of these missiles, the Kriegsmarine takes the body frame of the Type XB U-boat. During World War 2, the Type XB was originally used to lay water mines, the original mine silos are cut down and turned into missile silos for the new Fritz X missiles to create the ‚ÄúUnterwasser-Roketenboot‚Äù or ‚ÄúUndersea-Missileboat‚Äù. The new submarine can hold 30 of these new Fritz X missiles. Just like every other class of ship in the Kriegsmarine, The 5th Reich created a massive fleet of these submarines. Although the original Fritz X was used to destroy ships, the new Fritz X Missiles can be used for water to land and even Anti-Aircraft purposes.

===¬†[[Projekt Silberv√∂gel ]]===

Projekt Silberv√∂gel is a Maneuverable Low-Earth Orbital Bomber that can strike targets anywhere in the world. It carries one non-nuclear 10,000-kilogram bomb that is dropped from orbit. It has a top speed of 8,000 kilometres per hour and a maximum altitude of 4,000 kilometres in space.

===[[Projekt Anschluss MK.II]]===

A followup from the original Projekt Anschluss Tank, it features strengthened sloped armour, a better main gun, and other upgrades.

===[[Projekt Barrakuda]]===
Projekt Barrakuda, better known as the type XXIX-H U-Boat is a new Submarine built to replace the outdated Type IX and Type VII U-boats. The Type XXI will still remain in service due to its effectiveness and efficiency.

== Notable Events ==
This shows all the notable events of The 5th Reich. It goes from its creation from The Blitz to modern-day.

=== The Formation of The 5th Reich ===
Pretty self-explanatory. It came from The Blitz and after that, a government was set up and The 5th Reich was made.

=== Invasion of Afrika ===
During Operation Malaria, The 5th Reich invaded Afrika. It was highly successful and showed how powerful The 5th Reich is.

=== Construction of The Wall ===
After illegal Coutnryhuman immigrants attempted to cross the border between Germany, a wall was built around the entirety of Germany. It was almost identical to The Berlin Wall with the only difference being its gigantic size that stretched the entire border of Germany. It not only blocked illegal immigrants but also would help against enemy invasions. Guards would work 5-hour shifts each, and keep watch with binoculars all along the watchtower.

=== Experiment 13 ===
Experiment 13 showed a way to full convert Countryhumans back to their Human Counterparts (Example Russian = Slavic. Any Asian Countryhuman like Japan = Asian). It was instructed that all soldiers carry such items in their kit, although it never became an executive order, it is one of the most important items on a 5th Reich soldat.

===The Withdrawal of the Soviet Union, Polandballers, and Countryhumans===

Although pretty self-explanatory, it made The 5th Reich become alone with its only appointments being the bronies and the furries. It lost the Soviet Troops that it needed to be a full army, but by then they had been replaced anyways by 5th Reich troops. The Polandballers helped for The 5th Reich's original foundation and made a supply line. The same for the Soviets. With the supply lines cut off, Germany now could only depend on its Factories in its own area and the factories in Afrika. On the bright side, the struggle with the Countryhumans was over and Germany celebrated. Countryhumans could soon live inside of Germany much more now that they were neutral, and the importance of Der Wand rose. More checkpoints were opened up for new Visitors. Then, a Cold War occurred with the bronies and The 5th Reich. Because of how close The 5th Reich was to Brony territory, the bronies decided to take action and The Cold War started. The neutrality of all these factions was probably the most important part of Germany's timeline.

=== The Brony invasion of The 5th Reich ===
The Invasion began with capturing Erich Von Bleinspiller and taking him all the way to France. Fallschirmj√§ger Task Force 141 was dropped in to secure him. The mission to rescue Erich is succeeded, and he was brought back to the parliament building of Germany, the Reichstag, where he officially declared war on the bronies. The Bronies Launch a full scale invasion of Germany but the Germans Push them back in [[The Northeastern German Campaign]].

=== Small Brony Uprisings and the Supposed Death of Oskar M√ºller ===
During a Brony infiltration campaign, on not just The 5th Reich, but the world, a small Brony resistance group that opposed Executive Order 013 stormed The Reichstag although government officials had already been evacuated. A rocket strike using old soviet vehicles from World War 2 was authorized. The last soldier remaining, M√ºller, shot the flag carrier with a pistol, before being stabbed to death with a machete by a Brony. Fortunately, backup arrived in the form of Fallschirmj√§ger Task Force 141 by helicopter who quickly neutralized the resistance forces around Berlin but sadly had to pronounce M√ºller dead. However, they could not find a body of M√ºller and speculation arrived.

=== The Return of M√ºller ===
After a small Brony group held government workers hostage, it was found that M√ºller had rescued the workers and escorted them to safety. He had used cheat code before his presumed death that gave 30 extra lives to the user. With this, all gamer hybrids in the area, as well as pure gamers, were given controllers in order to be able to do the same cheat code in a dire situation.

=== The 5th Reich joins the [[United Anti-Swarm Forces]] ===

Erich Von Bleinspeiler, staying true to the original gamer diplomacy joins the United Anti-Swarm Forces to stop the Swarm form conquering the USGR, USF, And loyalist Territories. ‚ÄúIf they want a fight, we‚Äôll give em a fight! And so will they! *points to every faction aligned with the United Anti-Swarm Forces* as a former member of the gamer army during the first furry war I will not, And I mean WILL NOT! Let some Tea-sipping Desk Jockeys conquer our territory without resistance, they expect us not to fight because they have the ‚Äúlargest droid army in the world‚Äù. But do me and the 5th Reich give a crap!? NO! We shouldn‚Äôt just surrender to some droids and let them just walk right into our backyards, I say we give the fight of our lives and preserve the gamer doctrine!‚Äù

- General Bleinspeiler giving a speech to his people and the United Anti-Swarm Forces

After The War against the Swarm ended, The United Anti-Swarm Forces disbanded and the 5th Reich returned to its normal state until the 3rd Furry War began.

=== The Warning ===

The 5th Reich sends a live Broadcast to all USGR TV and Radio channels warning the Gamers that the USF may be planning an attack on the USGR. It is was unknown where the attack would take place. The 5th Reich sets up forces around its borders in case the attack is planned on them.

=== The Start of The Hamburg Space Program ===
Oskar M√ºller authorized a space program to take place with its main controls inside of Hamburg (hence it‚Äòs namesake). Within the first 3 days of the space program, a space station, 3 satellites, and new types of aircraft were made such as a supersonic satellite launcher, an upgraded Silberv√∂gel that had satellite launching and space shuttle properties, and a space station that could move on it‚Äòs own via thrusters.

=== Construction of the Vorhut Class Supercarrier ===

On March 25, 2020, The 5th Reich Kriegsmarine ordered a replacement for the outdated Graf Zeppelin Aircraft Carriers, The Kriegsmarine puts forward the blueprints for a massive Supercarrier to replace the Graf Zeppelin Aircraft Carriers, All Graf Zeppelin Class Carriers were scrapped and construction began on the new Supercarrier. The new Supercarrier was called the ‚ÄúVorhut‚Äù Class, the German word for ‚ÄúVanguard‚Äù. This new class of Supercarrier is 3,000 feet long and 500 feet wide and features a variety of defences systems for enemy aircraft, missiles, and torpedoes. It can also carry around 135 Aircraft of many different types. Like every other ship in the Kriegsmarine, the Vorhut Class will be Nuclear-Powered.

=== Freedom of Speech ===
Some time after Executive Order 009, and after thoughtful consideration from parliament, The 5th Reich decides to give freedom of speech and press to the people officially. It was a huge step in what Oskar M√ºller called: "Shaping us into more modern times."

=== The Moon Mining Operation ===

On May 30, 2020, in a secret covert operation against the Alt Furries with [[Alameda Country]] The 5th Reich launches a modified Silberv√∂gel to the moon to capture one of the last Alt Furry Leaders. With this new type of Silberv√∂gel the 5th Reich Ministry of trade proposed a plan to launch these Silberv√∂gels to the moon and create a mining base there to mine for moon rocks and other resources and sell these to other countries due to their extreme value, such as Alameda, The DRE, RSEL, The Soviet Union, The Void Hand Empire, ISAF, Autonomous Gamer Canada, DROP, And The UGR.

=== The Confederate Attack ===
The Confederates led an invasion against the Reich supported b The Chan Dynasty, The UPK, the Kyotian Empire, the SCO Republic, and the 2nd white army. The war is currently ongoing.

== Executive Orders ==
Many orders have been carried out by The 5th Reich. Here are some of them:

=== Executive Order 001: ===
The First order came while The 5th Reich was a resistance group, and the executive order is considered unofficial by many. It was the authorization of the bombing of Germany and to help all civilians get to a safe location as the bombing continued. It also instructed resistance members to take part in the raid. It also introduced a new currency for use by the military and civilians later to be able to buy and use military objects without having to worry about the cost.

===Executive Order 002:===
Considered to be the first order since The 5th Reich was now a government, it was humanitarian efforts made to help those affected by the bombing runs and to help rebuild buildings. It also mobilized some of the first military units to help in humanitarian efforts.

=== Executive Order 003: ===
This was the creation of the Afrika Korps. It also authorized the Full Invasion of Afrika for [[Operation Malaria]]. It sent plenty of weapons and supplies as well as paint for camouflage.

=== Executive Order 004: ===
This order authorized The Modernization of the former under equipped men who used world war 2 weapons and equipment and gave late 20th and early 21st-century equipment, all the while not replacing the old equipment entirely. Some old equipment was reused for an entirely different purpose like the ME-264 being used as a gunship.

=== Executive Order 005: ===
Although considered to be a part of Executive Order 004, It is still different as It authorized the Production of Projekt Anschluss. It authorized B-17 to help produce them, the opening of new factories, and private guards from The Tailbiters.

=== Executive Order 006: ===
This Order authorized only certain Countryhumans to live inside The 5th Reich. People were reluctant at first, but only a select few could come in and they were Placed on a heavy watch. The Countryhumans appreciated the action, but this order led to Executive Order 007. It had a huge impact on relations with Countryhumans,

=== Executive Order 007: ===
Executive Order 007 resulted in a wall built around Germany to prevent illegal Countryhuman immigrants from coming into the country. It also provided defence from many different enemies such as furries from France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and literally any country within Germany‚Äòs Radius. Not even the side facing Poland was open from The Wall. It also led to the creation of Wall Troops who kept watch on 5-hour shifts each day. It was also controversial amongst fake news publishers and led to Executive Order 009. However, Germany at the time still had open borders also including those in the Syrian crisis.

===Executive Order 008:===
Executive Order 008 was the authorization of any Countryhuman to be in The 5th Reich as long as they had a passport and permit. Some of the borderlines got so long, that people had to wait in Austria while others had to wait in Germany. This executive order also gave basic rights to Countryhumans. It declared that the Countryhumans would have equal rights such as getting paid the same amount of money and being sentenced for the same penalty for the same crime as any other person in The 5th Reich. It also authorized Countryhumans to join the armed forces, but they could not be drafted. Anyone who didn't follow these strict guidelines could be jailed for 3 months all the way to 15 years.

===Executive Order 009:===
Executive Order 009 was made to shut down any fake new outlets in Germany. Morale was lowered around Germany and when the administration looked into it, they found multiple news outlets spreading false information about The 5th Reich committing war crimes and not allowing innocent people into their lands. The 5th Reich finally sick and tired of all the conspiracy founded the S.S. Which stands for Super Soldat. They were the most advanced equipped units in the German army and wore the same uniforms and attires as SS troops. These soldiers, of course, were not nazis and had no resemblance to the Nazi S.S., and the uniforms had all insignias removed. They stormed the headquarters of fake news outlets to find the news writers printing papers about a U-Boat sinking a Countryhuman passenger ship during the alliance, a Food shortage in Berlin, and even claiming that furries were going to invade Rostock. The news outlets were quickly taken down and Germany noticed a better morale raise. The military also made their own newspaper to tell about the war, and children would sell their own newspapers about the situation in Germany. Controversial at first, Germany's sin rose to its greater glory but was criticized at the time immensely and it helped pave the way for Anti-German Protests.

===Executive Order 010===
This authorized Germany to build up more forces and conscript men who were 17 into the Wehrmacht. This was because of how tense the Cold War was between the bronies and The 5th Reich. Although the bronies noticed the change because of recon aircraft, they knew that they still had more men. The 5th Reich in the meantime had almost 10 troops conscripted every hour. The 5th Reich also set up a Naval Blockade around Brony Territories in order to stop them from attacking other countries.

===Executive Order 011===
Executive Order 011 was to strengthen the military even more after the Bronies had captured their leader. Projekt Anchkuss tanks were mass-produced and hundreds of millions of weapons for 5th Reich Troops. Other tanks were mass-produced as well as the World War 2 era aircraft The 5th Reich still had. Stronger helmets and better armour were made for soldiers, and the S.S. we're given camouflage uniforms instead of normal ones, and black ones from the original SS (with the nazi insignias removed) with slight altercations for modern warfare. Many of men in The 5th Reich were conscripted to finally take back Germany and the land they possessed.

=== Executive Order 012 ===
To remember those who died in The Warsaw Massacre Erich Ordered all 5th Reich Flags to be flown half staffed on August 21st-22nd, the days in which the Massacre occurred, every year. This would also honour the movement that formed The 5th Reich that same day as well as when Charlie (A Countryhuman advisor that contributed greatly to 5th Reich success) left the army, causing him to do what he is known for today.

=== Executive Order 013 ===

In the 13th Executive Order, The 5th Reich banned all bronies living in The 5th Reich, and also those with the slightest Brony references. Bronies were not allowed to have jobs, therefore, and All government officials had to undergo a test which made them watch MLP for a week before being asked by a Brony imposter if they would like to join the community. It also filtered out some secret Brony spies. It had a 20% fail rate, and The 5th Reich boosted its military. The Brony infiltration threat would soon be one of the smaller things on The 5th Reich's mind.

=== Executive Order 014 ===

As the Brony threat drew near, The 5th Reich gave the right to bear arms to its citizens in case of a Brony takeover, and that it ‚ÄúShall not be infringed‚Äú. The many people in The 5th Reich could now help soldiers in the front lines, and new resistance groups were formed in case of a Brony invasion of their main territory. The 5th Reich also noticed a drop in crime rate and decided to allow a wide variety of weapons to be allowed.

=== Executive Order 015 ===
Lacking money due to spending, The Reich imposed a tax on civilians. The tax could only occur with civilians' consent. The tax could also be stopped at any time. Military budget and the money owned by The 5th Reich, in general, had boosted. As time went on, more and more civilians began owing taxes until the government was boosting up to when they imposed a new currency at the beginning. The government later added a budget on government spending,

=== Executive Order 016 ===
Needing resources for new Projekts that were only available from other countries, The 5th Reich began importing and exporting goods. This allowed many resources to be brought to The 5th Reich from abroad and boosted the military even more. The variety of Imports and Exports grew so much that The Reich had to categorize different exports from other countries.

=== Executive Order 017 ===
After the brony wars end, The 5th Reich Tones down their forces by increasing the draft age to 24 and honourably discharging low ranks who were under the age of 19 for peacetime to help the economy grow.

=== Executive Order 018 ===

After joining the United Anti-Swarm Forces, Erich Order the mass Production of anything that can destroy any type of Swarm Android. This includes new EMPs developed at Site 42069 and a variety of new ‚Äúanti-drone‚Äú Equipment.

=== Executive Order 019 ===
After furries decide to start yet another war, The 5th Reich decides to keep their forces the way they were during the 2nd War and The Brony Wars. It would not only mean that they would be more prepared for conflicts, but they would be a superpower.
===Executive Order 020===
The 5th Reich finally went to catch up on space research. This executive order started The Hamburg Space Program as Hamburg was where most operations would be commanded from. The program started off with launching a satellite via supersonic satellite launcher, and the construction of a space station. This order also allowed new spacecraft to be built with gamers who played Kerbal Space Program being hired for the job to help 5th Reich scientists. The main goal of the space program is to set up X amount of colonies on the moon and mars, have at least 20 satellites in orbit, and at least 7 space stations.

=== Executive Order 021 ===
The 5th Reich ordered it‚Äôs fleet of outdated Graf Zeppelin Class Aircraft Carriers to be scrapped. The scrap will be used to build the newer and much bigger Vorhut Class Supercarrier.

=== Executive Order 022 ===
Upon thoughtful consideration and many debates inside of Parliament, The 5th Reich decided to officially allow freedom of speech, and to allow freedom of press, which has been unpopular ever since the media scandal was released to the public.
===Executive Order 023===
After Heavy criticism from multiple factions, and more debate's¬†amost¬†members of parliament, the 5th Reich has authorized the living of Bronies, an extremely limited amount of furries, and [[Dutch Angel Dragons]] in atempt¬†to be much more diverse, and to help the economy. Immigration rates started to get higher, and a small economic boom occurred from the new amount of employees in different business's.

=== Executive Order 024 ===
Due to recent trading conflicts with the International World Banking and Trading Association, and them¬†cutting off¬†multiple German Trade Routes, The Reichstag has made the Executive decision to ban the presence of the IWBTA of Any Kind within the 5th Reich.

=== Executive Order 025 ===
The 5th Reich made this executive order on terms of diplomatic relationships. It was said that from now on issues would try to be solved diplomatically. In preparation for the ongoing assault, the executive order was made to construct defense systems around Germany, and to provide safe housing for civilians in the Reich. Militia groups were also given official  government funding, forming the German National Guard (GNG/DNG).
