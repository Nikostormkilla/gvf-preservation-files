# gvf-preservation-files

Preserving the Gamers vs Furries wiki from Fandom so it doesn't get banned.

# The File Structure.

The file structure of this is pretty simple. Pages go in the pages folder and images go in the images folder.

# The end goal:

Our end goal is to preserve most of the wiki so it can be ported to Miraheze without as much hassle, as we have the images and html files as bases to structure the pages. This project will also have the goal of making the fandom wiki an archive of pages that have been updated on the new wiki without having the original pages completely archived. This will also contain the original html and images so you can reconstruct them for personal use. The archived fandom wiki won't allow comments or edits anymore and you must use the Miraheze wiki to edit pages.
